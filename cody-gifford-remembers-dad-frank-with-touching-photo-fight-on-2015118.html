(In addition, Frank had three children with his first wife, Maxine Avis Ewart.) They are also parents to Cody’s <a href=#>little sister Cassidy</a>, who shared her own memories of her father Monday.</p><p>“Very few people are blessed enough to call their father a legend, and an even smaller number are able to share that notion with the rest of the world,” Cassidy, 22, captioned a throwback Instagram photo of the two.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Yesterday, I lost my best friend…His kindness was infectious, and his grace, beyond compare..And despite the worldly passing of an incredible man, I undoubtedly know heaven gained one stud of an angel,” she continued. “Philippians 4:13 has never rung so true.. You were an unparalleled Giant in all sense of the word, Dad.. So keep doin’ you up there, because no one does it better, and no one ever will.”</p><p>Kathie Lee’s Today show coworkers, meanwhile, have also paid their respects to Frank and his family. On Monday, Hoda Kotb said that her <a href=#>dear friend and co-hos</a>t is staying strong during this difficult time.</p><p>“She said, ‘This is not a tragedy.’ I was holding her hand, and she said, ‘A 4-year-old girl having cancer is a tragedy,” Kotb recalled. “Frank lived to be almost 85.’ She said, ‘He lived an incredible life, has an incredible family, had an incredible legacy.’ She said, ‘His life is a triumph.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5Sueqi1xZ%2Bmq5xdp7KuscybnKurXZmupXnFq5ino12strW0jK2mrpuYnruoec%2Bhpq2nXZu2qLTTZqanZWJlfnZ9kHFm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
