Here are some food items you won’t want to miss trying if you want to eat like a local.</p><p><b>Sweetly Decadent Pineapple</b></p><p>You won’t be eating just any pineapple during a cruise to Ponta Delgada. You’ll be eating pineapple grown in the Azores, which tastes quite different from ones you may be used to in the United States. The pineapples found in the Azores are smaller and juicier and still pack a deliciously sweet punch. You’ll likely find pineapple alongside a variety of dishes – there’s even pineapple Carpaccio and pineapple liquor!</p><p><b>Fried Mackerel Eaten Like French Fries</b></p><p>Mackerel, a type of fish, is in restaurants all over the island because it swims all around the island – meaning any your order is likely a fresh catch of the day. If you want to eat like a local, order the fish fried as a side dish and eat them whole – yes, bones, and all – though you can leave the tail behind on your plate.</p><p><b>Black Sausage: A Family Tradition</b></p><p>Black sausage, also referred to as blood sausage, is a local specialty that has been passed down through many generations for many local families. The black sausage in Ponta Delgada is unique due to its seasonings, which include cinnamon – a spice that is grown locally in the Azores.</p><p><b>Cozido das Furnas Made in a Volcanic Slow Cooker</b></p><p>This may be the coolest meal you’ll have in the Azores; er, make that hottest – volcanic hot that is. Thanks to the active volcanoes located on São Miguel and some creative chefs, this local dish is sure to be unlike any you’ve had before since it’s cooked in volcanic soil. The dish itself is a stew that is made with black sausage, pork, beef, potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables. The stew Is prepared nightly and then buried in the volcanic soil of São Miguel’s large caldera early the next morning. The natural heat of the earth in this part of the island is the perfect temperature to slow cook the dish to perfection until it’s ready to be pulled out of the earth for dinner time. One of the most famous restaurants to order this in is Caldeiras & Vulcoes Restaurant, located in Furnas about 45 minutes from the Ponta Delgada cruise harbor.</p><p><b>Sip Some Local Tea</b></p><p>A good drink to sip on in the Azores is some local tea since the only industrial tea plantations in Europe are located in the Azores. Both Gorreana and Porto Formoso tea factories are located on São Miguel and produce premium-grade black teas and green teas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSusLPByKycrGaTpLpwv8Rop6iqpKh8sbvNrZhmnJWhtKKwwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
