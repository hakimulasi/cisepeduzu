They dated between 1998 and 2002, and after their breakup, he dragged her through the fire.&nbsp;His "Cry Me a River" featured a Spears look-alike and painted her to be the cheating lover, and another song — released four years after their breakup — condemned her, too. He spoke about their sex life in interviews, and continued his relentless shaming — especially once she had moved on, married, and had several children with soon-to-be ex-husband Kevin Federline.</p><p dir=ltr>It isn't just with Spears that he had a shaky record with dealing with women: When he was one half of that infamous Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction, it was Janet Jackson that got the backlash, the bans, and the blacklisting, while Timberlake's career just kept going up — something that people like Terron Moore (the editorial director of Logo and MTV) has publicly condemned.</p><p>Timberlake did finally apologize, issuing a statement on social media after the debut of the documentary "Framing Britney Spears," which called him out pretty good. He replied (in part, via <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>), "I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem ... or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEk3Jra3Ffqb%2Bis8icZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMmpmoraRiwamxjKamrquVoLK1scSrqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
