I prefer being called ‘Jedi.’</p><p>"I started getting called Jedi by team mates and coaches as well growing up and it's stuck so much that I introduce myself as Jedi these days just to make it easier. There's quite a bit of force in it."</p><p>We'll say.</p><p>He also has impeccable taste, declaring Return of the Jedi as his favourite Star Wars film and Anakin Skywalker as his favourite character.</p><p>The circle is complete.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Offers Of The Day</h3></p><p>Bet365 - Bet £10 Get £50 in Free Bets* - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></p><p>Open account offer.
