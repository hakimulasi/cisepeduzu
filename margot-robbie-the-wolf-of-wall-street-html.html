And when you’re auditioning for Martin Scorsese and alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> for what will hopefully be your first big break, something extraordinary is warranted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But Robbie went completely off the rails and did something so outrageous — the whole universe would have had to be working in her favor for that to turn out the way it did.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The famous slap she landed on DiCaprio’s cheek during their audition was a split-second decision and a good one, too. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>All Or Nothing</h2><p>“I got caught up in the moment,” <a href=# rel=follow>Margot Robbie</a> once joked when talking about the incident, following that up with,&nbsp;“it was stupid.” And while it might have been stupid, it amazingly did not backfire. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>So, what actually happened?</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">auditioning for her first big role</a>, Robbie was hell-bent on making an impression. She and DiCaprio were acting out a scene. It was an intense scene where both their characters were in a heated argument. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All this was going on outside, but inside, Robbie was thinking about how she had to grab that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “You have literally 30 seconds left in this room and if you don't do something impressive nothing will ever come of it,” she was saying to herself.</p><p>The scene keeps going, and they’re both screaming at each other. She said she could barely keep up with his intensity.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>DiCaprio ends his lines, still in character, saying, “You should be happy to have a husband like me. Now get over here and kiss me.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Robbie did think about kissing him. But that thought got&nbsp;overridden by another part of her brain, which told&nbsp;her to do the apparently stupid thing — slap him.</p><p>So she walks up to him and lands, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">as Scorsese put it</a>, a “thunderclap of a slap” on DiCaprio’s face and even followed&nbsp;that up with a '[expletive]&nbsp;you,’ none of which were in the script.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Gamble Pays Off</h2><p>The room went “dead silent” after the slap. She froze. But the slap did its job — made a good impression. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That was Robbie and Scorsese’s first meeting, and she clinched the role of Naomi right then and there. “An improvisation that stunned us all,” said Scorsese on the note he penned for her&nbsp;in 2017.</p><p>DiCaprio was stunned, too. Robbie feared he would sue her, but he asked her to slap him all over again.</p><p>Going through Scorsese’s note, we get to know how impressed he was with her. When a guy like him can come up with nothing more than “Like no one else” while describing someone, that speaks volumes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The note ends with a line probably no one will disagree with — “Margot is stunning in all she is and all she does, and she will astonish us forever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRp7SwwIyrppuamZp6tbTEZq6opJZivKd51pqjpWWjqb%2BmsdNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
