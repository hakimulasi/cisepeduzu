As of January 2023, Sunetra Sastry’s net worth is roughly <strong>$1 million</strong>. She averages $37,000 per year in income. She worked as a makeup artist on “Black Adder.”</p><p>Sunetra is a well-known makeup artist in the industry, and her work is admired by numerous celebrities. She has worked on numerous projects, including those for the BBC and her ex-company, Rowan Atkinson Production, founded by her husband.</p><p>As part of the divorce settlement, she received a house worth $10 million. The home is equipped with cutting-edge features, such as underground stops and superior architecture.</p><h2><span id=Children_of_Sunetra_Sastry>Children of Sunetra Sastry</span></h2><p>She has not disclosed her parents’ names. Her mother was of English descent, while her father was of Indian descent. Growing up in England, she was vulnerable to racial discrimination due to her mixed heritage.</p><p>Her parents had planned for her to become a nurse, but after graduating from high school, she decided to enroll in a beauty college in London.</p><p>Her parents were initially opposed to her pursuit of that path, but they finally came around when they realized it was her wish to pursue it.</p><h2><span id=Sunetra_Sastry8217s_Wedding_Husband_and_Marriage>Sunetra Sastry’s Wedding, Husband, and Marriage</span></h2><p>Mr. Bean, sometimes known as Rowan Atkinson, was her husband. She first met him in 1986 while working as a make-up artist for the BBC1 pseudo-historical scenario comedy “Black Adder.” Three years of dating before their engagement in late 1989.</p><p>In February of 1990, the couple wed at the legendary Russian Tea Room in New York City. Stephen Fry acted as the best man for Rowan. Their first child, Benjamin, was born in 1993. In 1995, they were given the gift of a daughter, whom they called Lily.</p><p>Benjamin Alexander Sebastian Atkinson is a trainee police officer, whereas Lily is a known actress whose credits include Johnny English Reborn, Mr. Bean’s Holiday, and Tooth. Sunetra and Rowan were living a blissful married life till a new woman entered their lives.</p><p>In February 2014, their 24-year marriage began to crumble when Rowan began seeing actress Louise Ford. Rowan and Louise met in the 2013 premiere of Simon Gray’s play “Quartermaine’s Terms.”</p><p>Sunetra has reached her breaking point and filed for divorce. Since her spouse was not present for his hearing, her petition was granted in 65 seconds. As part of the divorce deal, her ex-husband gave her a $10 million mansion.</p><p>\Lily was outraged by her father’s behavior and referred to him on social media as “Dick Head.” She also elected to forego her father’s surname in favor of her mother’s maiden name, Sastry. Their son Benjamin, however, did not appear to be happy and had no desire to follow in his father’s footsteps.</p><h2><span id=Rowan_Atkinson_controversy>Rowan Atkinson controversy</span></h2><p>The romance between Rowan and Louise began in 2014. Before dating Rowan, though, Louise dated the comedian James Acaster. James stated that he read about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him and his subsequent relationship with Rowan in the media.</p><p>James saw the distance between them widen when Louise took the role of Quartermaine’s Terms opposite Rowan at Wyndham’s Theatre in 2013.</p><p>Louise had been with James for two years before she left him for Rowan. James continues to joke about being abandoned by Mr. Bean. The fact that Rowan is 28 years older than Louise did not prevent them from falling in love. In December 2017, they welcomed a daughter named Isla.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrtiy Ex Wife</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Mr. Joe Ehrlich, Learn More About Joanne Weir’s Spouse</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Kyle Inskeep- Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqMKvsdOrmGarkajBs8WMnZytnaKitq%2BxjK2fnmWimq60u81mnaiqXZ2ys3nDoq2oqpOaeqe%2BzqZkoZ2iYrW2v8GapZ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
