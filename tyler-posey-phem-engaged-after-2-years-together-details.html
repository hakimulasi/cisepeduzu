Phem’s favorite place,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Teen Wolf&nbsp;</i></a>alum, 31, told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;</i>on Thursday, June 1, noting the proposal occurred earlier this year. “We <a href=#>spend every Valentine’s Day there</a> so it only felt perfect to do it there.”</p><p class=p1>Phem, 27, had teased her <a href=#>diamond ring</a> via Instagram Stories several hours earlier. “Hehehe,” she captioned a Wednesday, May 31, selfie with the oval-shaped bauble.</p><p class=p1>Posey and the “Sorry Mama” songstress <a href=#>began dating in 2020</a>, nearly one year before they publicly debuted their romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Teen-Wolf-Alum-Tyler-Posey-Is-Engaged-to-Girlfriend-Phem-After-2-Years-of-Dating-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>“We met through the notorious [music producer]<strong> John Feldmann</strong>,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Maid in Manhattan</a>&nbsp;</i>actor revealed during a joint appearance with Phem on the <a href=#>“The Allison Hagendorf Show”</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;“I was on Feldy’s label, Big Noise, and we were [working on] our second EP. … One day, he hit me up early into the EP writing and was like, ‘Hey, I’m gonna have an artist come write with you.’ I’ve never done that before and I was like, ‘That’s a great idea. I know her, we have mutual friends.’”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;“Flowers” musician&nbsp;— who admitted to host <strong>Allison Hagendorf</strong> that she’d do “anything for Feldy” —was initially wary about working with a Hollywood actor. “[He’s] very masculine-presenting. I was nervous,” she explained on the May 26 episode. “I was like, ‘I can’t give off any sexual vibes’ because I’m really aware of that going into sessions. I don’t want it to be about that.’”</p><p class=p1>Lo and behold, Posey and the “STFU” artist — who showed up to the writing session dressed in a muumuu — quickly hit it off. The pair announced in February 2021 that they had started dating.</p><p class=p1>Amid their romance, Phem helped the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jane the Virgin&nbsp;</i></a>alum publicly <a href=#>come out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community</a>. “I’ve been with everybody under the sun, and right now I’m in the best relationship that I’ve ever been in with a woman, and she’s queer too,” Posey told <a href=#>NME</a> in an interview published in July 2021. “She’s helped me realize that I fit under the queer umbrella and that I’m sexually fluid, I guess. No, not ‘I guess.’ I don’t want anyone to take this [interview] and be like: ‘Well, he was kind of wishy-washy about it.’”</p><p class=p1>Prior to his romance with Phem, Posey was briefly engaged to longtime girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Seana Gorlick</strong></a> in 2013. They<a href=#> ultimately split one year later.</a> The&nbsp;<i>Lincoln Heights&nbsp;</i>alum has also been linked to <a href=#><strong>Bella Thorne</strong> </a>and his&nbsp;<i>Truth or Dare&nbsp;</i>costar <a href=#><strong>Sophia Taylor Ali</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I kind of mess relationships up sometimes,” Posey <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2019</a> following his split from Ali, now 27. “I don’t know if I’m meant for them.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Last Summer&nbsp;</i>actor confessed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time<i>&nbsp;</i>that he has felt pressure to have a “perfect” relationship based on the ones he’s portrayed in movies and TV shows. He added: “I feel like an asshole when I don’t fall in line with that. And I don’t think I fall in line with it. So, [being single is] a newfound thing and I’m very, very happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZyav268zqycsmWgnbKuecSnnpqflZl6orLTnqlmal2usqK%2B0marqJ%2BVqbWmvoydnK2ZmaHAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
