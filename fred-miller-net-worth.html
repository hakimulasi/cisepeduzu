Fred Miller was born in Houston, Texas, in 1973, and played college football along the offensive line in his home state for the Baylor University Bears. The St. Louis Rams drafted Miller with the 141st overall pick during the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft. Miller played with the Rams until he joined the Tennessee Titans from 2000 until 2004 and later the Chicago Bears from 2005 until 2008. The six-foot-eight, 314-pound offensive tackle was part of the Rams' victory in Super Bowl XXIV in January 2000 when St. Louis knocked off the Titans.</p><p>He ended up singing a free agent deal with the same Titans team during the following offseason. Miller made headlines in 2005 when his fellow Bears teammate <a href=# title="Olin Kreutz Net Worth">Olin Kreutz</a> broke his jaw during some kind of brawl. The team initially blamed Miller for breaking his own jaw as he tried to get out of bed in the middle of the night. Both Kreutz and Miller ended up receiving $50,000 fines from the league for the incident. At the time of his retirement, Miller played in 192 career NFL games and made 164 starts. Since leaving football, he spent two seasons coaching North Shore Country Day School's football team in the Chicago suburbs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jp%2BpnpxdoratuMSrZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
