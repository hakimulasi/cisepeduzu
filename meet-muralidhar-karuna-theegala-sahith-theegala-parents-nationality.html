Let’s find out Sahith Theegala parents’ nationality along with more facts about the couple.</strong></p><p>Muralidhar Theegala and Karuna Theegala are the parents of American professional golfer Sahith Theegala.</p><p>Their 23-year-old son is a rookie in the PGA Tour, proving his worth in the Sanderson Farms Championships. He is currently leading the points table.</p><p>Although Sahith is the 2020 Hawkins Award Winner, he only made it to the PGA Tour recently. And there is an interesting&nbsp;story&nbsp;regarding his success. Apparently, he changed his driver, the wood category of golf clubs, and with that, he changed his luck as he secured his Tour card.</p><p>He is also the recipient of the Ben Hogan Award and the Jack Nicklaus Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sahith-theegala-parents-%e2%80%93-muralidhar-theegala-and-karuna-theegala></span>Sahith Theegala Parents – Muralidhar Theegala And Karuna Theegala<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sahith Theegala was born to his parents Muralidhar Theegala and Karuna Theegala on 4 December 1997.</p><p>His parents, as well as the relatives of the extended family, follow him during his games. His dad never says “Good Luck” or “Play Well” to him but says “Have Fun.”</p><p>In addition to supporting their son, Muralidhar and Karuna, along with their relatives, also encourage other competitors. Now that’s quite a show of love for the game.</p><p>Muralidhar once&nbsp;talked&nbsp;about his son’s young days. He said that Sahith used to push too hard when he was young, and he told him to trust his game. That piece of advice seems to have helped Sahith shape his game.</p><p>He also added that he took his 10-year-old son to a practice area at a local private country club near their home in the Los Angeles suburbs, and as they walked into the practice area, a man walked up to them and lectured on race, probably not a good one.</p><p>Apparently, the man&nbsp;blurted&nbsp;out, “You are not allowed” instead of “Who are You?” Murlidhar said that the behavior was due to the difference in skin color. But that sort of racist treatment didn’t seem to have affected Sahith’s career.</p><p>As for Sahith’s mother, Karuna, not much is known. Although not confirmed, a Linkedin page suggests that a person with the same alias as Muralidhar is the Team Manager at the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California – is it the same person?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=muralidhar-theegala-and-karuna-theegala-nationality></span>Muralidhar Theegala And Karuna Theegala Nationality<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Regarding Muralidhar and Karuna Theegala’s nationality, they are Indians by origin but have American citizenship.</p><p>Muralidhar was born in Hyderabad, India. However, Karuna hasn’t disclosed her birthplace publically. Nonetheless, the nationality of the two has been portrayed as Indians by most of the media sources.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWVmsFuudSrmKWhlJ2us3nKmqmuppFiwamxxKCYpZldqK6ptdOhZK2glZq0orjAZqeaqpWjwbR5zZqroqeelrmqwNho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
