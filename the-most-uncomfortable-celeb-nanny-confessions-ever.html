The employee allegedly wanted&nbsp;$1.5 million and warned that, if the couple didn't pay, she would "accuse [them] both of a vicious laundry list of false terribles." The Lowes preemptively sued&nbsp;former nanny Jessica Gibson, who herself&nbsp;filed legal papers <a href=#>alleging that</a>&nbsp;Rob had "<span class=s3>placed his hand inside Gibson's pants in order to touch her crotch" and "grabbed Gibson's buttocks without consent."&nbsp;</span>Accusing the couple of sexual harassment, Gibson alleged they'd both treated her in a manner that was "offensive, insulting, unwelcome, mean, perverted, crude and lascivious."</p><p>Then in May 2008, another&nbsp;former employee named Laura Boyce offered her own uncomfortable celeb nanny confession when she shed tears at a press conference, confessing that she quit working for the couple because she "could no longer put up with Mrs. Lowe's conduct towards [her]." As People reported, Boyce filed her own lawsuit, claiming Sheryl would repeatedly strut around the house naked and allegedly&nbsp;made racist remarks about Boyce's boyfriend. In <a href=#>court documents</a>, the distraught nanny claimed Sheryl created a "sexually offensive and hostile work environment" and regularly used the N-word in reference to her boyfriend. Cringe-inducing accusations, but was any of it true?</p><p>We'll never know. Both cases were unceremoniously <a href=#>dismissed</a> in 2009, with lawyers refusing to divulge whether any&nbsp;<span class=s1>settlements&nbsp;had been reached (via <a href=#>People</a>).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplboNxe9OhnGaln6jBbsHNnKamnp%2BnwaKuy55knJ2cmq9uusCnpbJlk6S7p7HSrKCopqNisrex0Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
