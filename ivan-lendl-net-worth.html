Until recently, he served as the coach for world No. 1 Andy Murray. His playing career started in 1978 and ended in 1994, and since the he has been working as a tennis coach.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Ivan Lends is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Lendl’s net worth is as high as $40 million, earned through his successful career in the tennis world, during which he won 94 titles, eight of which are Grand Slams. Apart from success on the court, Ivan had also several lucrative sponsorship deals, which also increased his wealth.</p><h3>Ivan Lendl Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>Ivan is the son of Olga, Czechoslovakian tennis No. 2 player in the country, and from an early age he was introduced to tennis. While playing as a junior he reached the No. 1 position in 1978, winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. After that he turned professional, and immediately proved himself worthy of the media attention he was receiving at the time. In 1980 he won seven titles, including in Barcelona, Spain, Basel, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada, defeating such tennis stars as <a href=#>Björn Borg</a>, and Guillermo Vilas in the finals.</p><p>He continued successfully through the early ‘80s, and in 1981 won Las Vegas, Madrid, Vienna and Volvo Masters, New York City. The following year he won an incredible 15 titles, but was still without a Grand Slam trophy on his shelf. However, that changed in 1984 when he first won the French Open, defeating <a href=#>John McEnroe</a> in five sets after trailing 2:0. In 1985 he won the US Open, again beating <a href=#>McEnroe</a> but this time in straight sets. From 1985 until 1987 he was ranked at No. 1 on the ATP list at the season’s end, and repeated the success in 1989. In 1986 he won his second French Open, and defended his title at the US Open, while at Wimbledon he was stopped in the final, losing to <a href=#>Boris Becker</a>. The following year came his third French Open title, beating <a href=#>Mats Wilander</a>, who had taken top ranking from Lendl from September 1988 until January 1989. The two faced in Grand Slam finals at the US Open in 1987 and 1988, with Lendl winning in 1987 and Wilander the next year.</p><p>Ivan’s first Australian Open title came in 1989, defeating his countryman Miloslav Mečíř in straight sets, making it his eighth Grand Slam in 19 finals. His last Grand Slam was also Australian Open, won in 1990, when he defeated Stefen Edberg. Lendl played tennis actively until 1994, and won his last title in 1993, at the Tokyo Indoor, Japan, making it his 94th title. He was forced to retire due to the chronic back pain.</p><p>He was away from tennis for quite some time, before returning in late 2011 as Andy Murray’s coach. The two collaborated until March 2014, and during that time, Murray won two Grand Slams, including 2013 Wimbledon. Nevertheless, that wasn’t the end of their collaboration, since Lendl again joined Murray’s coaching team and helped him in great way to take the No. 1 position on the ATP, from Serbian tennis star <a href=#>Novak Djokovic</a>.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Ivan became a US citizen in 1992. He has been married to Samantha Franket since 1989; the couple has five children together, and they split their time between residences in Goshen, Connecticut and Vero Beach, Florida USA.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.7882775119617><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ivan Lendl</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 7, 1960</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Ostrava, Czech Republic</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.88 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>174 lbs (79 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Tennis player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Samantha Frankel (m. 1989)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Isabelle Lendl, Daniela Lendl, Caroline Lendl, Nikola Lendl</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Olga Lendlova, Jiri Lendl</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>איוון לנדל , Лендл, Иван , 伊万·伦德尔</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1961891/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Compared to contemporaries like John McEnroe, he had a more gentlemanly reputation on the court, seldom arguing calls with officials.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Has five daughters.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=8><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>Wimbledon</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Coach, Andy Murray</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Today at Wimbledon</td><td>2014-2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Coach, Andy Murray / Himself - Coach Andy Murray / Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Na plovárne</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Vivement dimanche</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself (Interview)</td></tr><tr><td>Only at the Open</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Signature Series: Pete Sampras</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>17th Annual American Century Championship</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>16th Annual American Century Championship</td><td>2005</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Mundo VIP</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</td><td>1995</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The 1988 US Open Tennis Championships</td><td>1988</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>La balle au mur</td><td>1988</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Wimbledon '87</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Wimbledon '86</td><td>1986</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The French</td><td>1982</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqKtmqZdobKvsMtmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
