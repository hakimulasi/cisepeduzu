You receive this armor by speaking with Eva in the Tower Courtyard, where she also hands you multiple quests to work on as you progress.</p><p data-injection=true>You earn several currencies during the Solstice of Heroes: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Silver Leaves</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Silver Ash</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kindling</a>. The most basic of these currencies, Silver Leaves, go to you as you complete multiple activities, such as Vanguard Strikes, Crucible or Gambit matches, Patrols, or Public Events. You will only receive them while wearing your Solstice Candescent armor. You will not receive Silver Leaves if you do not wear this armor, which makes it challenging to earn the later currencies, namely Silver Ash and Kindling.</p><p>You will receive more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Candescent armor</a> pieces as you complete Bonfire Bash activities alongside other Guardians you can use to improve your current sets. Eventually, the armor will receive a distinct glow as you add Kindling and apply Silver Ash to the Embers. If you choose to remove this armor for whatever reason while the Solstice of Heroes is happening, Silver Leaves will not drop for you.</p><p>The <strong>Solstice of Heroes 2023 is set to end on August 8, 2023</strong>. You have until this date to complete all of the quests from Eva and earn the highest quality of Candescent armor available to your character.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
