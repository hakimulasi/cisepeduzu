Monroe, meanwhile, donned an all-white look that included a tutu and tiara like her mom, while Moroccan, for his part, rocked a red sweatshirt and black pants. The 11-year-old accessorized with a gold chain around his neck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Carey shares her twins with <a href=#><strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a>, who recently welcomed his 11th child, daughter Beautiful, with <a href=#><strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong></a> and is expecting baby No. 12 with <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Scott</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Drumline star, 42, also shares twins Zion and Zillion, 17 months, with La Rosa, 32, sons Golden, 6, and Rise, 2 months, and daughter Powerful Queen, 23 months, with<a href=#> <strong>Brittany Bell</strong></a>, as well as daughter Onyx, 2 months, with <a href=#><strong>Lanisha Cole</strong></a> and son Legendary, 4 months, with <a href=#><strong>Bre Tiesi</strong></a>.

The New York native’s attempts to trademark “Princess Christmas” and “QOC” were also “rejected and denied.”&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After Carey filed the initial application in March 2021, she<a href=#> received backlash when <strong>Elizabeth Chan</strong> and<strong> Darlene Love</strong></a> spoke out against her desire to seemingly make the holidays about herself and for profit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Christmas has come way before any of us on Earth, and hopefully will be around way after any of us on Earth,” Chan, 42, said in an interview with Variety in August 2021. “And I feel very strongly that no one person should hold onto anything around Christmas or monopolize it in the way that Mariah seeks to in perpetuity. That’s just not the right thing to do. Christmas is for everyone. It’s meant to be shared; it’s not meant to be owned.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Love, for her part, revealed that<a href=#><strong> David Letterman</strong></a> had given her the title of “Queen of Christmas” back in ‘80s after performing the classic “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” on The Late Late Show With David Letterman each season for nearly three decades.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Is it true that Mariah Carey trademarked ‘Queen of Christmas’?” Love, 81, wrote via Facebook in August. “What does that mean, that I can’t use that title? David Letterman officially declared me the Queen of Christmas 29 years ago, a year before she released ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You,’ and at 81 years of age I’m NOT changing anything.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2Wdlr%2Bqrcdmmpqqla7AbrfInapmop%2Beu265wJywrGWUlsZuvMCrmJ2dXay2tbSMpqamZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
