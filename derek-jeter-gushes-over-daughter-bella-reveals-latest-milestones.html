She’s pulling herself up,” he gushed exclusively to Us Weekly. “She’s standing up. She’s going to be walking soon.”</p><p>The former New York Yankees captain, 43, and wife <strong>Hannah Jeter</strong> <a href=#>welcomed their first child together in August 2017.</a> The couple have no concrete Father’s Day plans yet, but they did celebrate Mother’s Day in Miami over the weekend.</p><p>“I was at work early. We had a game yesterday, and we went out to dinner,” the part owner of the Miami Marlins told Us. “We spent time with our daughter, put her to sleep and then took her [Hannah] out to dinner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The model chimed in that the two dined at Cipriani, a restaurant downtown that has a waterfront view of Biscayne Bay.</p><p>The athlete, who married Hannah in July 2016, previously opened up about fatherhood during an interview with CBS This Morning’s Jeff Glor in February. “By far the most gratifying thing I’ve ever been a part of,” he said at the time. “Regardless of how your day went at work, when you get home and you see a smile on your daughter’s face, it makes it all worthwhile.”</p><p>Besides work, the first-time dad has been promoting The Stuff, which is cowritten by his sister <strong>Sharlee Jeter</strong> and <strong>Dr. Sampson Davis</strong>. The book details difficult experiences people have gone through and how they were able to rise above their tragedies. While interviewing survivors, Davis and Sharlee uncovered 11 common elements essential to success in the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadnaKauG62xK2cq2WXqsCpsdJmpq%2BdomKxosHGoaueql2Xsq24wGapnq6Vlrm0ecuaq56rpGK6qrjErKuoppWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
