Lose the top part of your tree in a house move. Preferably in April as you don’t have the opportunity to go back to your local waste collection and search through your garbage once you realise you have thrown it out.</p><p>2. Have a son who wants to decorate the tree now and instead of waiting until you replace the tree.</p><p>3. Allow your son to use every decoration you have collected over thed few years to throw onto said tree.</p><p>4. Sit back with a coffee for an hour in peace while your son is occupied decorating said tree.</p><p>5. (This is the most important part of the steps) DO NOT look on Kmart inspired homes at everyone’s beautiful trees they have created.</p><p>6. Question your life choices.</p><p>The post gained hundreds of comments from other amused mums who all agreed she was a legend for embracing the chaos of 2020 with such a tree.</p><p><i>This story was originally published on <a class=body-link href=#>Kidspot</a> and is republished with permission</i>.<br eom-tag-name=br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNoo52Wv7W%2FjKyYnWWimravsMSeqWarpKSwrLXNoGSsrJWWubR5wqGpoqukoq60ecKhnJ6qXZ67brnAp6yfmZOpwrO1zaBkppmcm8Kvr9OipqdnnprEtHnSraarsV%2BbfXSwkGuZcJtiZ4V0gMVrb3BsaWyAp67CnWdtbWKbsQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
