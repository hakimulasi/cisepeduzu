Though you couldn‚Äôt deny his good looks seven years ago, the BLK Water founder wasn‚Äôt always the hard-muscled beefcake he is today.</p><p>Most recently, he flaunted his insanely fit physique on July 24 when he posted <a href=#>a shirtless pic</a> of himself holding up his young pal Olivia on his broad shoulders while hanging out at the pool. In the sizzling snap, Albie‚Äôs chiseled abs glisten in the sunlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/albie-caroline-2-83b656a7-99af-4f86-860d-cea68d0e8326.jpg><p><span>Before showing off his taut torso, the TV personality ‚Äî who now stars alongside his mom on her </span><i>Housewives</i><span> spinoff, </span><i>Manzo‚Äôd With Children</i><span> ‚Äî gave his 250,000 followers free tickets to his gun show. On July 5, Albie put his bulging biceps on display in a fitted black T-shirt while posing next to his buddy Frank Catania Jr., the son of </span><i>RHONJ</i><span> newbie </span><b>Dolores Catania</b><span>.</span></p><p>And on Independence Day, Albie gave America a reason to celebrate when he uploaded a picture of himself sprawled out across a doughnut floatie while sunbathing during another pool day. In the shot, his perfectly sculpted pecs and six-pack are front and center as he smirks for the camera.</p><p>On June 16, the single stud revealed the secret behind his physical transformation: online classes with Core Rhythm Fitness. After signing up for the program earlier this year, he shared a before-and-after collage featuring a photo of himself in his softer days paired next to a present-day pic of himself in fighting form.</p><p>‚ÄúThe guy on the left was who I saw in the mirror that day, the guy on the right was who was pushing the pen,‚Äù Albie wrote. ‚ÄúI am delighted to say they are two very different people üòä.‚Äù</p><span class=caption></span><p><i>Manzo‚Äôd With Children</i> returns to Bravo for its third season on Sunday, September 11, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmaKkuaq6xGakmqaqpMBuv86nZJqkkp6ybrPOrWSsraCav6m702aqnp1dnba0ecCmmLOhnpx6oq7SZq5ta2NrfXN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
