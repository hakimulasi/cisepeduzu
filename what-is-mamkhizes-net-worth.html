Her popularity soared recently after she launched her top-notch reality TV show, Mam’Mkhize, which shows on the Mzansi Magic channel. The KwaZulu-Natal-born businesswoman is considered one of the richest women in the country – thanks to her multiple income streams. MaMkhize’s net worth, business prowess, run-ins with the law, and extravagant lifestyle are some of the reasons she is a person of interest among the public.</p><h2><strong>MaMkhize’s Net Worth Is Over R300 Million&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>She found her way into the business world back in the early 2000s and has never backed out from her journey into entrepreneurship. Her success story began with the business group Zikhulise Group, which was reportedly founded by her mother. She took over the reins following her mother’s death in 1999.</p><p>Shauwn’s mother was a political heavyweight and anti-apartheid fighter in her time. Her daughter made her way to the top through her influence and, of course, a dint of hard work. MaMkhize is heavily connected and has worked on several government projects that yielded millions for her.&nbsp;Through sheer hard work, the businesswoman has become one of the forces to reckon with in the South African business community, with a net worth of about R300 million.</p><p>Despite her successes, the KwaZulu-Natal native hasn’t stopped topping up her already fat bank account. She keeps expanding her empire from time and time, and she seems unstoppable. Probably, one day she could become the richest woman on the continent in the future.</p><h2><strong>A Look At the Sources of Shauwn Mkhize’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Hard work pays. No matter how long it takes one to get to the top, it can only become easier when one is hard working. MaMkhize may be enjoying the best moments of her life now, but it actually took her a whole lot to get to this point in her life.</p><p>She started with the Zikhulise Group, and with the help of her now <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>ex-husband</a>, both were able to grow the company to a billion-rand-asset. The businesswoman has since diversified her income streams, spreading her tentacles to other sectors of the economy.</p><p>From real estate to sports business and more, Mamkhize has shown that it takes vision, courage, initiative, versatility, and risk tolerance to go far in business. It is worthy to note that she amassed her impressive wealth through all her income channels.</p><p><strong>Let’s find out how Shauwn Mkhize’s net worth accrued:</strong></p><h4><strong>1. Zikhulise Group&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Way before the 2000s, not too many women were in the construction business in South Africa. However, Shauwn Mkhize was among the few women who owned a construction company as far back as the early 2000s. Her company, the Zikhulise Group, was prominent, having been founded by her mother, who was also a public figure.</p><p>The businesswoman and her family’s huge wealth first came through this company, although its monetary value has never been publicly published before. In the early 2000s, Zikhulise was awarded a contract to build low-budget RDP houses on about 4500 sites in Umlazi Infill, KwaMgaga, and Umlazi B10 in eThekwini municipality. This contract alone fetched Shauwn and her family millions and more connections in government.</p><p>The company is said to have also secured another multi-million contract from the<br>KwaZulu-Natal government afterward. Zikhulise is believed to have won several other tenders and contracts from both private and government establishments.</p><p>There are several other companies under the Zikhulise Group umbrella corporation. Some of them include the Zikhulise Auto Restorers (a 100% BEE registered company established to employ and empower individuals, especially historically disadvantaged people) and the Inyanga Security Services (a professional security company).</p><h4><strong>2. Real Estate</strong></h4><p>Shauwn has more than 20 years of experience in the property business, and it’s good to know that she is doing great for herself despite been a male-dominated industry. She hasn’t put out much of her real estate business for the public to see but being a self-acclaimed strategist; we have no doubt she will continue to excel in the business.</p><h4><strong>3. Royal Eagles Football Club</strong></h4><p>Until 2019, the Royal Eagles Football Club, a KwaZulu-Natal-based football club, was co-owned by Shauwn and her husband, Sbu Mpisane. However, she lost the battle for the club’s ownership to her ex-husband during their divorce proceedings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/sis2-e1642460979779.jpeg><p>The couple acquired the club in 2014 and eventually moved it to KwaZulu-Natal province as part of their effort to improve the club. Though Mr. Sbu is now fully in charge of the club, the fact that Shauwn benefitted from the club during the time she was co-managing it with her ex-husband cannot be determined.&nbsp;Part of the socialite’s wealth came from the Royal Eagles.</p><h4><strong>4. The Reality TV Show – MaMkhize</strong></h4><p>MaMkhize is a reality television show that documents the life of Shauwn, her relationship with her family, and other lesser-known aspects of her life that the public does not know, such as their spending habit and life’s challenges. The TV show is owned by the socialite, and it has been doing pretty well since it debuted.</p><p>Mkhize’s bid to clear her name and change people’s perception of her were some of the factors that triggered the launch of the TV show. She wanted to set certain records straight and show the world who she is and not what the media or opponents say she is.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Through the show, the public has come to understand her better and got to know more about how she relates with every member of her family, especially her only son <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Andile Mpisane</a> who she pampers a lot.&nbsp;MaMkhize has won the world’s attention since it debuted as well as some awards.</p><h4><strong>5. Royal AM Football Club&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>After Shauwn was struck off from her position as Royal Eagles’ co-owner, she didn’t allow her dream of becoming a football manager to wither just like that. In another move, she was able to buy another South African football club known as the Royal AM Football Club.</p><p>She co-owns the club with her beloved Andile Mpisane. The duo reportedly acquired the club with a sum of R50 million in August 2021. Andile is currently the chairman of the club. Royal AM competes in the South Africa Premier Division (PSL).</p><h4><strong>6. Royal AM Luxury and Grooming Pampering Lounge</strong></h4><p>The Royal AM luxury and grooming papering lounge is one of the luxurious lounges in town. It is literally a 5star lounge established to cater to the specific needs of the people. Part of their services includes manicure, pedicure, saloon, and other essential beauty services.</p><h4><strong>7. Acting Career</strong></h4><p>Shauwn Mkhize goes all for it when it comes to making money. Recently, she was unveiled as part of the cast of the South African popular soap opera, Uzalo. The businesswoman cum actress has made several on-screen appearances since she debuted.</p><p>Though the exact money she makes on Uzalo is not publicly known, it is believed that the amount is quite substantial.</p><h3><strong>Mamkhize Owns A Football Club&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Mamkhize owns just one club – the Royal AM football club. She runs the affair of the club with her son, Andile Mpisane. They bought the club 2021 for R50 million and are already moving the club to a great height. The Royal AM was formerly known as Bloemfontein Celtic. The original owner, Max Tshabalala, sold the club three days before the 2021-2022 league season kicked off.</p><p>There’s hasn’t been any report of the businesswoman buying another club or intending to acquire an additional club as individuals are not allowed to own more than one club. It is pertinent to note that the Royal AM football club is an amalgamation of Bloemfontein Celtic and the Royal team that played in the GladAfrica Championship in the 2020-2021 season.</p><p>After Mkhize purchased the status of Celtic, she also managed to sell Royal’s first-division status to the owner of the Limpopo-based club Marumo Gallants FC (formerly known as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila), Lawrence Mulaudzi, in the same week. So, he doesn’t own two clubs, just one.</p><h2><strong>She Has Also Been Involved In Some Charity Works With Her Family</strong></h2><p>One of the attributes of most successful individuals is that they always give back to society. Mamkhize’s case isn’t different. While some people are of the opinion that she hasn’t given back enough to society considering her net worth, the businesswoman, on the other hand, believes that giving comes from the heart and not something one does to show off.</p><p>Shauwn Mkhize added that she doesn’t have money lying around waiting to be donated to people but that she will never stop giving because of people’s opinions.</p><p>Here are some of her philanthropic activities.</p><ul><li>In January 2020, she worked with the Department of Sports, Arts, and Culture and was allowed to choose any school of her choice to make her donations to.</li><li>Her family some time ago donated shoes and sanitary pads to Umlazi ComTech High school.</li></ul><p>It’s not clear if there are other ways she gives back to society apart from the donations listed above.</p><h2><strong>A Look At Mamkhize’s Run-Ins with the Law</strong></h2><p>Most successful people are no strangers to controversies, and Mamkhize isn’t different. The businesswoman has had her fair of drama and controversies while ascending the ladder of financial success. Let’s take a look at all the time she has made headlines for reportedly being on the wrong side of the law.</p><h4><strong>1. Fraud Arrest</strong></h4><p>The flamboyant businesswoman got arrested in 2013 on charges of fraud. She is said to have provided false information to the Construction Development Board, which gave her access to R149 million worth of government tenders. However, in 2014, all charges of fraud and tax against her were withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority.</p><h4><strong>2. Tax Controversy</strong></h4><p>Even after the National Prosecuting Authority had dropped the charges against her, the business mogul wasn’t free from the hands of tax masters. SARS claimed that Mamkhize had an accumulated tax debt of R204 million.</p><p>The socialite took to her Instagram page to state how she was cajoled, mocked, shamed, violated, and publicly humiliated. She also mentioned that the media took matters into their hands and judged her before the court made any pronouncement on her. However, the TV personality mentioned that she stood firm on the ground that when God says yes, nobody can say no.</p><h4><strong>3. Seizing of Mamkhize’s Family Fleets</strong></h4><p>As if the Mamkhize hadn’t had enough to deal with, she was accosted by members of SARS who descended on her Posh La Lucia mansion located at Durban. They seized some of her family assets, including some of her luxurious cars (2 Porsche, a dodge ram, a Ferrari, a Maserati, and a BMW). However, some other sources claimed that 25 luxury vehicles were taken away from the mansion. The business tycoon had to pay R5.6 million to a court-appointed curator to regain her fleet.</p><p>SARS also paid her another visit in 2019 at the same mansion. However, the details of this second visit are not known by the public.</p><h4><strong>4. Mamkhize Convicted for VAT Fraud</strong></h4><p>Sunday Times 2012 report stated that the socialite was convicted of VAT fraud in 2015. For her penance, she was fined R15000 and also received a three-year jail term, which was later suspended for five years.</p><h4><strong>5. Losing the Royal Eagles’ Club to Her Estranged Husband</strong></h4><p>When Mamkhize and her husband Sbu Mpisane had issues in 2019, she tried her best to effect a stronghold on the club. She gave in her best to re-register the club again in her name, but her attempt failed.</p><p>However, sources have it that she succeeded temporarily in changing it to Royal AM in honor of her son. However, this victory was short-lived as this was changed back to Royal Eagles FC. That was the point she gave up her part of the club’s ownership. Her son, Andile, took to Instagram to bash his father, whom he noted hadn’t put much interest and care in the club as much as his mother did, including financially.</p><h4><strong>6. Bribery Charges</strong></h4><p>Records have it that the socialite was arrested in 2012 for allegedly trying to bribe a witness involved in a fraud case.</p><h4><strong>7. PSL Brouhaha</strong></h4><p>In September 2021, the KwaZulu-Natal-born reality TV star was charged with bringing the Premier Soccer League (PSL) into disrepute after she allegedly made racist and sexist statements about South African high court judge Roland Sutherland.</p><p>In a video she posted online, Mkhize questioned if a ruling by Sutherland was being honored “because he’s a white man.” Her statement was triggered by the unfavorable ruling against her club after they took to the law court to be reinstated as GladAfrica Championship winners.</p><p>Royal AM was displaced to the playoffs at the end of the 2020-21 season by an arbitration award of three points to Sekhukhune United, a decision that didn’t sit well with Shauwn.</p><h3><strong>The Businesswoman Is A Role Model And A Huge Inspiration To Many</strong></h3><p>MaMkhize is one of the most outstanding personalities South Africa has. Though no one is without flaws, she stands out as a pride to the black community as she has successfully carved a niche for herself and made a life for her son.</p><p>She achieved success and attained fame while she was still married. One can assert that many young girls and women look up to her as a role model, especially those from the black community. She is a typical example of one’s background not holding them back from succeeding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK%2BYlsFutdJmpJqlm522u7HSZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
