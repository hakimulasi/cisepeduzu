I'm also not ashamed to say that I can't trust anyone who wasn't a little in love with Jonathan Taylor Thomas back in the day. I am, however, a little bit ashamed at some of the <a href=# class=T3D><i>characters</i> from '90s movies that I was in love with</a>. Look, we all have them — crushes we developed that we now regret — but there's something about those '90s films that really brings that embarrassment home.</p><p>Let's face it: it wasn't weird to be <a href=# class=T3D>in love with Leonardo DiCaprio after <i>Titanic</i> </a>. In fact, it was probably more embarrassing not to be. But, what about Billy Zane, the non-iceberg <i>Titanic </i>villain? Or that massive crush on Simba, you know the <i>animated lion</i> from <i>The Lion King</i>? (It's not that weird, I swear!) Some crushes were embarrassing from day one, while others make you shudder upon reflection (Sebastian from <i>Cruel Intentions</i> was a grade A jerk, people). Regardless of how or when you were embarrassed, these <a href=# class=T3D>17 male '90s characters you were in love with</a> certainly aren't ones you likely brag about today.</p><h3>1. Dr. Ian Malcolm — <i>Jurassic Park</i></h3><p>There was something undeniably hot about Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Ian Malcolm. Who could forget that chest shot? But there's also something undeniably weird about seeing Goldblum as a almost heartthrob.</p><h3>2. Simba — <i>The Lion King</i></h3><p>Sure, he was voiced by JTT and Matthew Broderick, but Simba was an animated character, and a freakin' animal. Not exactly what you think of when you think of childhood crush... and yet.</p><h3>3. Trip Fontaine — <i>The Virgin Suicides</i></h3><p>OK, so it's not exactly embarrassing to have a crush on Josh Hartnett, but his character in <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> is basically evil. And that makes justifying a crush a heck of a lot harder.</p><h3>4. Sebastian — <i>Cruel Intentions</i></h3><p>Let's settle this once and for all: Sebastian was slime. Ryan Phillippe was hot, but Sebastian was not.</p><h3>5. Casper — <i>Casper</i></h3><p>Hi, my name is Olivia, and I had a crush on a friendly ghost in the '90s. NBD.</p><h3>6. Chuckie Sullivan — <i>Good Will Hunting</i></h3><p>Yes, OK, yes, I like Ben Affleck in this movie more than Matt Damon. There, I said it.</p><h3>7. Rod Tidwell — <i>Jerry Maguire</i></h3><p>Are there any four words a woman wants to hear less than "Show me the money"? Loud, cocky and over-the-top, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was almost unbearable. Almost.</p><h3>8. Austin Powers — <i>Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery</i></h3><p>Austin Powers may have been a ridiculous character, and not a very attractive one at that. But still, you can't deny that his goofy charm didn't at least make you daydream a little bit.</p><h3>9. Jesse Jackson — <i>She's All That</i></h3><p>Yes, that is Foggy Nelson from <i>Daredevil</i>. But, before he was Foggy, Elden Henson played Lanney Boggs' BFF, Jessie Jackson in <i>She's All That</i>. Maybe not as hot stuff as Freddie Prinze Jr. at the time, but, man, oh so cute.</p><h3>10. Paul Finch — <i>American Pie</i></h3><p>So many adorable, if not slightly disturbing, young men in <i>American Pie</i>, and while people mostly stuck with crushes on Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), or Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), some of us were lusting after Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Yep, the one who slept with Stifler's mom.</p><h3>11. Michael — <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i></h3><p>Michael (David Krumholtz) was often overlooked in favor of adorable nerd Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), so it wasn't exactly considered cool to crush on him. But, he pretended to be Shakespeare for a woman, OK? It melts my heart every single time.</p><h3>12. Wooderson — <i>Dazed And Confused</i></h3><p>Because there's nothing more embarrassing than having a crush on this guy, even if he <i>is</i> Matthew McConaughey.</p><h3>13. Harry Dunne — <i>Dumb & Dumber</i></h3><p>Jeff Daniels' Harry Dunne sure is dumb. If only the heart listened to the mind...</p><h3>14. The Mask — <i>The Mask</i></h3><p>Jim Carrey in <i>The Mask</i> is absolutely terrifying, which made your strange crush on the green monster even more confusing.</p><h3>15. Robin — <i>Batman & Robin</i></h3><p>A crush on Chris O'Donnell is nothing to be embarrassed about, but admitting to have loved any part of 1997's <i>Batman & Robin</i> is almost never acceptable.</p><h3>16. Barney Thompson — <i>Pretty Woman</i></h3><p>Played by Hector Elizondo, Barney was the manager at the hotel in <i>Pretty Woman</i> who was so suave, sweet and funny he was impossible not to love. Of course, he was also far from a romantic character in the film, so admitting your crush could be a little bit awkward.</p><h3>17. Kocoum — <i>Pocahontas</i></h3><p>Kocoum was definitely attractive (for a cartoon, obviously), but he was also boring AF which made it safer to lie and say you were Team John Smith like your friends. But in secret, Kocoum was all yours.</p><p>Now that many of your embarrassing '90s crushes are likely out in the open, one question remains: who are you going to be embarrassed to have fallen in love with in the 2000s?</p><p><i>Images: Universal Pictures; <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (17)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZVpcGplYWx6rq3LnmRyaKNisKmt0ZqarZ2iqHq6u9Rmrp6qlWLAtrzEq2SepZKWv7Ot0qycnWWRl7y2wIybnKKml2K2r3nLqK2eZaeewak%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
