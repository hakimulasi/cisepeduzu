He then jump-started a career in politics. He spent a while serving as a campaign adviser to <a href=#>Robert Kennedy</a>.</p><p>After Kennedy's assassination, Jerry continued to practice law in Cincinnati where he was elected to the city council in 1973.

In 1982, he ran for governor of Ohio but did not win his party's nomination.</p><p>While he was mayor of Cincinnati, he had featured commentaries called "The Springer Memorandum" on radio station WEBN-FM. &nbsp;The popularity of these commentaries launched Springer's broadcasting career. The NBC affiliate in Cincinnati, WLWT, hired Springer as a political reporter. When Springer came on board, it was the lowest-rated news program in Cincinnati.
