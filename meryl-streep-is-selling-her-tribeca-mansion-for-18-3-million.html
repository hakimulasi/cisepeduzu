Town & Country reports that Streep is selling her <a href=#>Tribeca</a> penthouse, and she's looking for a buyer willing to shell out $18.3 million. Interestingly, that price point represents a bit of a discount, compared to when Streep tried to sell the property before. In August of last year, she listed it for some $25 million, and evidently wasn't able to find a buyer.</p><p>That's not a reflection on the penthouse though, which is a luxurious waterfront spot in Tribeca, with cutting edge appliances and incredible views of New York through expansive floor-to-ceiling windows throughout. It has four bedrooms – three especially designed to accommodate guests – and five bathrooms, as well as a media room and study, all spread out across almost 4,000 square feet at the top of River Lofts tower, which is naturally outfitted with plenty of amenities of its own. As the penthouse's official listing puts it:</p><p><strong>"The work of National Design Award–winning Tsao & McKown architects, the full-service River Lofts condominium features a recently renovated fitness center, a 24-hour doorman, a bicycle room, a garden, and an easily accessible on-site garage. From the building's elegant lobby, a keyed elevator leads directly to a private vestibule in the penthouse. It overlooks the popular Hudson River Park, and the shops, restaurants, and other attractions of TriBeCa—New York's cultural capital—and SoHo are steps away."</strong></p><p>And it can all be yours for just $18.3 million, surely a small price to pay to live in the former home of acting royalty like Streep. You can also take a closer look at the penthouse in the video below from its official listing at Sotheby's International Realty:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGedmr%2B6uIysq6udlaV6qr%2BMrJylpJmjtG60xKtkraqZl7KkrYymmKermaS7brLOq2RqcF1oeq61y6WgqKZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
