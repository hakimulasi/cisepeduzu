At that time, Riot released their first band, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentakill</a>, and the first Worlds music video, Warriors by Imagine Dragons.</p><p>Afterwards, they made two more music bands. One is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K/DA</a>, and the other one is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">True Damage</a>. K/DA was initially formed with Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai’Sa. Their first song, Popstars, was such a hit that, later on, they made a new hip-hop group called True Damage. True Damage consists of champions like Ekko, Yasuo, Akali, Senna, & Qiyana. While their first song, Giants, was an instant success, it didn’t reach the same heights as Popstars.</p><p>Later down the years, Riot brought back bands like Pentakill and K/DA with new songs and skins. However, we didn’t see any new bands released by Riot Games. But recently, they made a new boyband called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartsteel</a>. Not only that, but they also released a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new song, Paranoia</a>, and some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new skins</a>. And to celebrate the release of this new band, Riot is going to release a mythic variant of one of the most beloved True Damage members, Ekko. That mythic skin is called <strong>Breakout True Damage Ekko</strong>.</p><p>This mythic Ekko skin is similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Cosmic Erasure Jhin</a>, where it is just a VFX and model overhaul over the base legendary skin. The animations, voice-over, and everything else are the same as the base True Damage Skin. With that said, similar to Dark Cosmic Erasure Jhin, this skin is not worth it to purchase.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartsteel Kayn Legendary Skin</a>.</p><h2 id=breakout-true-damage-ekko class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Breakout True Damage Ekko</h2><h3 id=splash-art class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Splash Art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Breakout-True-Damage-Ekko-1200x675.jpeg><h3 id=breakout-true-damage-ekko-price class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Breakout True Damage Ekko Price</h3><p>The only way you can get the True Damage skin is through the opening a specific capsule. While there is a small percentage to get the skin from the get-go, on the 30th open, you are guaranteed the mythic skin. If you were to open the capsule 30 different times, it would cost you $200. It is still absurd for a skin, let alone a recolor, to cost this much. Due to these reasons, I would advise against buying this skin.</p><h3 id=release-date class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Release Date</h3><p>The Breakout True Damage Ekko mythic skin will be released alongside the Heartsteel skins in <strong>Patch 13.22</strong>, scheduled for <strong>Wednesday, November 8, 2023</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2BXv6atyqisrWWkp8KmecOapJqflWKyrLfOZqSyrJiesG6%2FyqKlZqugoa60tIyaqa1loKe2pLGMq5ylnZGosm6wwK2caA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
