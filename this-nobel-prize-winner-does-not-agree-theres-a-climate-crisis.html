One of these is the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, John F. Clauser.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Parliament_of_Naysayers></span><strong>A Parliament of Naysayers&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In what turned out to be an effort to get the word out, Clauser spoke at a Baltimore conference not long ago. He stood as a mouthpiece for a group of like minds called the “climate deniers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-15.png><p>This category of people don’t deny the fact that the earth’s climate is changing. However, they don’t support the narrative that the planet is headed for an impending climate crisis.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Crux_of_Unpopular_Opinions></span><strong>The Crux of Unpopular Opinions&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But for Clauser’s presence at the news conference, involving a handful of people, the gathering would easily have been shrugged off as a mere racket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-17.png><p>On the contrary, the contributions and support of a recent Nobel Prize Winner gave the gathering some weight. Despite their unpopular opinions about climate change, the world is starting to pay attention.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Could_an_Egghead_be_Ignorant></span><strong>Could an Egghead be Ignorant?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Clauser has not always been a climate denier, or if he has had that opinion for long, he never made it public before the Baltimore conference.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-10.png><p>So, Clauser’s statement that “there is no climate crisis” left the science world in total shock. The Nobel Prize Winner was not the only speaker at the conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Formula_for_Conspiracy_Theories></span><strong>The Formula for Conspiracy Theories&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The organization behind Clauser’s Baltimore keynote speech is called the Deposit of Faith Coalition. It is an organization with Catholic roots, and its members believe there is a conspiracy theory behind the global climate change campaign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.png><p>According to this group, the earth’s climate crisis is a false narrative being noised by institutions like the World Economic Forum, the Vatican, and the United Nations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physicists_are_Naturally_Controversial></span><strong>Physicists are Naturally Controversial&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Clauser is an 80-year-old physicist who won a Nobel Prize in 2022, for his studies on light particles. According to Clauser, that research from the 1970s made many see him as crazy, because the theories were unpopular at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png><p>In comparison, Clauser claims his climate denial is just another unpopular opinion, which he has the right to hold.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Skepticism_Gone_too_Far></span><strong>Skepticism Gone too Far?&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A fair dose of skepticism is at the root of all scientific advancement. So, a couple of fine minds like Clauser also believe a climate apocalypse is out of the question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-16.png><p>For example, the likes of Princeton’s Emeritus professor William Harper, MIT’s Richard Lindzen, and Steven Kooin—all physicists—believe global warming suits the earth just fine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Clouds_and_Global_Warming></span><strong>Clouds and Global Warming&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, several climate experts around the globe have not been sympathetic with the theories of the likes of Clauser about climate change.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.png><p>The theory of the Clauser caucus is that the planet Earth adjusts accordingly as it warms up. For example, they believe that clouds have a net cooling effect on the planet. So, no matter how warm it gets, the planet self-regulates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Climate_Experts_Point_to_Evidence_Around_the_Globe></span><strong>Climate Experts Point to Evidence Around the Globe&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Climate experts like Michael Mann from the University of Pennsylvania have torn the theories of climate deniers to shreds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-8.png><p>According to him, contrary to the believe that the clouds have a cooling effect, they in reality encourage warming. Mann claims that several studies have proven it that clouds help planet earth retain green house emission, causing net warming.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patriotic_Intellectuals></span><strong>Patriotic Intellectuals&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the physicists and climate scientists are going for the jugular, one physicist chose to be liberal and objective. Austrian Anton Zeilinger shared the 2022 Nobel Prize with Clauser and commends the septuganerian’s scientific tact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7.png><p>Yes, Zeilinger may not accept Clauser’s theories about the earth’s climate, but he acknowledges the man’s intellect.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physicists_are_not_Climate_Experts></span><strong>Physicists are not Climate Experts&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An interesting trend has been noticed among the climate deniers, Clauser inclusive: they are mostly physicists, and not climate scientists. So, climate experts believe these naysayers can only theorize, but cannot provide tangible evidence that planet earth is not heading towards a climate crisis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png><p>For example, Clauser has no peer-reviewed publication, and there are claims that some climate deniers receive research funding from fossil fuel companies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Complicity_of_Big_Oils_in_Climate_Change></span><strong>The Complicity of Big Oils in Climate Change&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, Clauser insists that he does not receive any honorarium from anyone whatsoever for his unpopular views on climate change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-14.png><p>In fact, since making his views public, Clauser has lost some of his affiliations. He was billed to deliver a seminar on climate models at the International Monetary Fund. However, the appointment was suddenly canceled without any reasonable explanation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwam10malqJqVoXqxvsiznGavmaO7pr6Mnaaeq12jvLV5wKCpnp1dqbWmvsSsZJplk6G2rq3TnmScqpmotrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
