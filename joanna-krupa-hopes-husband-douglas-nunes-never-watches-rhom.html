I hope not because I wanted him to get to know me, you know, how I am with him,” the 41-year-old model says in Us Weekly’s exclusive clip of the digital series <a href=#>Life After Bravo</a>. “So honestly, he never mentioned to me if he did or not, but I hope he didn’t.”</p><p>Joanna goes on to explain that she’s not the same person she was during her two seasons on RHOM.</p><p>“I was in a different place in my life at that time. So he hasn’t really seen that side of me. I feel like if he watched it, he would be like, ‘Who is this person? I don’t recognize this person?’ It was Joanna in the good old days,” she says. “He probably would have not married that Joanna back then.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-Joanna-Krupa-Hopes-Husband-Douglas-Nunes-Never-Sees-RHOM.jpg><p>The Bravo alum married the businessman in 2018 after her divorce from <a href=#><strong>Romain Zago</strong></a> was finalized.

He is an amazing father, he’s a great husband,” Joanna tells Bravo. “He’s an amazing cook. I have, like, 10 pounds I still have to lose after the baby but because my husband loves to cook so much that’s not happening anytime soon.”</p><p>Joanna adds that her 6-month-old daughter is her proudest accomplishment in life.</p><p>Joanna adds that her 6-month-old daughter is her proudest accomplishment in life.</p><p>“She’s like the love of my life,” she gushes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>RHOM aired for three seasons from 2011 to 2013.
