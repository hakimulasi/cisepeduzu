Nonsense.”</p><p>“Unfollowing,” another commented, while others announced that they wouldn’t be buying Maybelline products any longer after seeing the video.</p><p>Over on Twitter, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one response</a> played on Maybelline’s catchprase, “maybe it’s Maybelline,” and said “maybe it’s NOT Maybelline.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Nothing inspires me to buy makeup more than seeing it smudged on the face of a bearded man,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another tweeted.</a></p><p>The Post has reached out to Vita for comment.</p><p>Representatives for Maybelline and its corporate parent, L’Oreal, also did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.</p><p>The ad marks the second time so far this year that the drugstore makeup brand has come under fire for the influencers featured in its advertisements.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In March — shortly before <a href=#>Mulvaney’s disastrous partnership with Bud Light went live</a> — the transgender social media star promoted Maybelline’s concealer with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> captioned with #MaybellinePartner.</p><p>In the video, Mulvaney was “getting glam for my Day 365 show,” a one-night-only live show that celebrated the 28-year-old’s 365th day of publicly identifying as a woman.</p><p>The post, which Mulvaney shared with her nearly 2 million followers on March 13, has since amassed more than 1.5 million views, and also spurred protests against Maybelline that could be likened to the <a href=#>wave of boycotts against Anheuser-Busch’s Bud Light.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Maybelline faced similar backlash when it tapped embattled influencer Dylan Mulvaney for a video promoting its concealer. <span class=credit>dylanmulvaney/Instagram</span></figure><p>On Twitter, one user wrote in response at the time: “The latest fools to employ Dylan Mulvaney are make-up company Maybelline.
