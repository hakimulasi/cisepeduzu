Followers of the Kar-Jenner clan know that Lamar and Sabrina Parr broke up last year only to reconcile their romance one more time before finally calling it off for good again just a month or two later.</p><p>The news came as a bit of a surprise considering the news reports about their relationship always seemed so positive with a couple of small exceptions. Before then, Lamar was married to Khloe Kardashian.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Aaron Carter</a>, as well, has endured his own controversies in the media as well, including for car crashes, drug addiction, therapy, rehab, and also family drama with his older brother, Nick, a member of the Backstreet Boys.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and celebrity boxing matches à la Celebrity Deathmatch (without dying) are now a real thing.

It’s in his blood.</p><p>Odom went on to say that he was looking forward to showing off his practicing and training on Aaron’s “face,” and it would be “retribution for Nate Robinson.” “This is gonna be easy work,” Lamar explained.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lamar was obviously referring to the way Mr. Robinson <a href=# rel=noopener>got knocked out by one of the Paul brothers in recent news.</a> It was especially humiliating for Nate considering his history as an athlete compared to Paul, who, despite his talent, came up as a YouTuber and a social media personality and not in athletics.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclrqivoyom6ilXZa7pXnAmqmopl2YrrPAxKtkrKCRp7JursCcomaZnpl6p7vRrZ9mrKKWwKl505qjpKGenHqitMSam2anlmLBqbHIq2SuqJOkuqq6xmaZqLCZo7RuucCtmqFlZGyCeIGUaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
