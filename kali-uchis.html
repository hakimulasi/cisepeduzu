The opening lines serve as a manifestation of the singer's newfound belief in miracles and breaking free from the curse that has held her back. She acknowledges that no one can give her what she wants, but this does not deter her from seeking a better life.</p><br><p>The subsequent lines offer an escape from the present situation as the singer urges her lover to leave this hopeless town with her, assuring that nobody can stop them. The phrase "Let's think about it tomorrow" is repeated, emphasizing the need to live in the present and not dwell on the future or past. The following verse tells the story of a young girl who had to turn to prostitution to support her family. It further emphasizes the theme of seeking a better life and not letting one's circumstances hold them down.</p><br><p>The chorus reiterates the need to leave behind their present situation and seek a better life, with the singer calling for them to burn together like a comet in the sky. The song's lyrics are a call for change and a better future, with the emphasis on living in the present and taking action to create the future they desire.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Today is the day I'll learn that I believe in miracles</u><br>I will experience something so shocking and unexpected that it will reignite my faith in the impossible</p><br><p><u>I can feel the world opening up, I think I broke the curse</u><br>An indescribable feeling of liberation has taken over me and I believe I have finally broken the spell of negativity that held me back</p><br><p><u>Now I won't grab you by the arm when you go</u><br>I no longer feel the need to hold onto you tightly and control your decisions because I trust in myself and the universe</p><br><p><u>No one can give me what I want</u><br>I realize that my happiness and fulfillment can only come from within and not from external sources</p><br><p><u>Yeah, I know</u><br>I have come to this realization and there is no going back</p><br><p><u>Let's get out of this hopeless town</u><br>I feel suffocated by the negativity and limitations of my current environment and want to escape it</p><br><p><u>Nobody can stop us now</u><br>We are unstoppable and no obstacle or person can prevent us from chasing our dreams</p><br><p><u>And time's on our side</u><br>We have plenty of time to achieve our goals and aspirations</p><br><p><u>While our hearts stay young</u><br>We will maintain our youthful spirit and enthusiasm even as we pursue our ambitions</p><br><p><u>Let's think about it tomorrow</u><br>We will not worry about the future today and instead focus on enjoying the present moment</p><br><p><u>Daddy said he needed money</u><br>Her father was struggling financially and desperate for a solution</p><br><p><u>So he put her on the street (street)</u><br>He resorted to pimping out his daughter as a means of making money</p><br><p><u>She had just turned thirteen</u><br>The daughter was still a child when she was forced into this situation</p><br><p><u>Got a family to feed (feed)</u><br>The father felt trapped and had to make a difficult decision to support his family</p><br><p><u>Yeah we grew up in a hurry (that's when she met me)</u><br>Both the singer and the victim of the song had to mature and face the harsh realities of life at a young age</p><br><p><u>Daddy got a little worried (American dream)</u><br>The father's hope for a better life in America drove him to make desperate and immoral choices</p><br><p><u>Las horas se me hacen siglos aquí</u><br>The hours feel like centuries to me here</p><br><p><u>Dame un beso que me dure una eternidad (come on let's go)</u><br>Give me a kiss that will last for all eternity</p><br><p><u>Porque nunca voy a regresar, nunca (come on let's go)</u><br>Because I will never return, never</p><br><p><u>Te invitio si quieres y como un cometa en el cielo (come on let's go)</u><br>I invite you if you want, and we will shine bright like a comet in the sky</p><br><p><u>Nos quemaremos juntos Nos quemaremos juntos</u><br>We will burn together, we will burn together</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Karly Marina Loaiza, Kevin Parker</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIORobagocKhoKxnhKS6sL7RqK4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
