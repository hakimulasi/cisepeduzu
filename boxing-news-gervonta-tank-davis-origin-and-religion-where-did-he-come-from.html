In an active resume of 25-0, Davis has 24 stoppages under his belt and is undoubtedly one of the finest in the world right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has already been a PPV star, honed by the great Floyd Mayweather. Having shown similarities with Mayweather, there’s a lot awaiting the youngster ahead.</p><p>Coming from a tough childhood, Davis is now a millionaire. Here’s a look at Gervonta Davis’ heritage and history.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-20-year-old-student-collapses-and-dies-due-to-a-charity-boxing-match?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/10065b52-f312-43ae-a3b8-0453b4ef20af-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">20-Year-Old Student Collapses and Dies Due to a Charity Boxing Match</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Is Gervonta Davis Hispanic?</h2><p>A lot of people thought Davis to be Hispanic or Mexican after he donned the Mexican national colors in his walk-out for the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Leo Santa Cruz</a> fight. However, it was just a follow-up to what his mentor <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Floyd Mayweather</a> did against <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Oscar De La Hoya</a> back in 2007. Several casuals assumed Davis to be a Mexican after that.</p><p>However, ‘Tank’ is a proud American and has been one of the most entertaining pugilists to come from the country. While he is already a renowned superstar in the USA, Davis is rapidly becoming a global phenomenon.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Gervonta Davis’ hometown: Where did he originate from? Is he an American citizen?</h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>‘Tank’</a> was born on November 7, 1994, in <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Baltimore</a>, Maryland USA. He still represents the same city and is clearly an American citizen. Coming from a middle-class family, Davis dropped down from education to pursue his career in boxing.</p><p>And it fetched him the right results. Aged 18, he became a pro-boxer and is now a world champion. Thus, it has been all glory for the youngster so far.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What is Gervonta Davis’ ethnicity? Does Gervonta Davis follow a religion?</h2><p>According to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reports</a>, Gervonta Davis comes from a mixed ethnicity. Many <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reports</a> claim him to be an African-American, but Davis has never spoken openly about it. He is a Christian by birth. Nicknamed ‘Tank’, Davis is now looking to explore the lightweight division more. And he is already in the top-tier conversation.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Top 5 Best Selling PPV Fights of Floyd Mayweather’s Boxing Career</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZp6eqqaku7WtjK2Yp6Ndma63tdJmpquhl567bq3NnWSrnZyetKq7zWauoZ2imnqltcNmn55lk6S6pnnFq6amZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
