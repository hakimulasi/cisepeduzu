Pregnant <strong>Bristol Palin</strong> revealed on Monday, Oct. 12, that she's expecting a baby girl.</p><p>"7.5 months with my baby girl," <strong>Sarah Palin</strong>'s daughter, 24, wrote, alongside a snap of herself cradling her burgeoning baby bump.</p><p>While the baby's gender is now known, the identity of the child's father still remains a mystery. Alaska native Palin announced in June that she was <a href=#>expecting her second child</a>, abruptly after ending her engagement to <strong>Dakota Meyer</strong> the previous month.</p><p>At the time, Palin caused a bit of an uproar after her pregnancy announcement. "Honestly, I've been trying my hardest to keep my chin up on this one," Palin blogged at the time. "I know this has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family, to my close friends, and to many of you. But please respect Tripp's and my privacy during this time. I do not want any lectures and I do not want any sympathy."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Palin shares her 6-year-old son, <strong>Tripp, </strong>with her high school sweetheart, and twice ex-fiance, <strong>Levi Johnston.</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, the outspoken conservative activist <a href=#>created an uproar</a> last Wednesday, after she blogged her objection to providing free birth control for minors and low-income women. Interestingly enough, Palin started working with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy after she got pregnant with Tripp back in 2008.</p><p>"Do you remember what it was like to be a 10-year-old? I remember being an unabashed tomboy concerned with playing outside and acing 5th grade," she wrote. "It is crazy that the government is offering a controversial form of birth control that can have serious life-long side effects to 10-year-old children," she wrote, "but then to do all of this behind a parent's back is simply outrageous!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJmroaOpvK15z5qjoqZdpb%2Bms82apa1lp57BqXnAZpmamqlitKq%2By2aZrqWgYr2pu9OoZGtoYWp%2BdH2P</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
