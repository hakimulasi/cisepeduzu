Filmmaker Angela Ismailos is the ex-girlfriend of billionaire shipping magnate <a href=#>George Economou</a>. She claims that he cheated her out of a $240 million settlement after she helped make him into the billionaire he is today.</p><p>The former couple met and began dating in 1994. At the time, Ismailos claims that Economou was "a struggling ship owner with five old vessels co-owned by a bank."&nbsp; Economou soon moved Ismailos into a $1.8 million Park Avenue home of her own. Ismailos claims that over the next 20 years, she was a key part of Economou's success.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241412 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-124363413.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241412 class=wp-caption-text>Stefania D'Alessandro/Getty Images</p><p>The couple never married. In 2012, Economou signed an agreement promising Ismailos a 50% stake in his company. When their more than two-decade long relationship ended in 2015, Economou refused to pay. Allegedly, he pressured Ismailos to waive her rights to the money in exchange for a $200,000 payment to save her Park Avenue home from foreclosure. Ismailos is arguing that the foreclosure deal should not be valid because it was signed under duress.</p><p>Ismailos filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court.</p><p>This case is ongoing and is sure to be a doozy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfl7atuMiopZqhoprAbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krJ2VoLavs4xra2llnZ65rbXOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
