I’ve been watching The New Girl, and… it’s not a bad show, AT ALL. It’s actually really cute, bordering on “pretty awesome, actually.” After years spent as a supporting player in big-budget films and a sometimes-lead in independent films, Zooey has finally found herself helming what could be a solid television show with a long future. Now, even though my general warmth for Zooey as an actress has increased, she also pisses me off as a person. She always strikes me as a too-cutesy hipster chick trying too hard to be “different” and “wacky”. Maybe her personality is genuinely wacky and quirky. Or maybe she’s just a pretty normal girl who puts on airs to stand out.</p><p>All I know is that she’s 31 years old, and it wouldn’t hurt her to start dressing and acting her age in public. BUT – I do enjoy how The New Girl is built around Zooey’s quirks and weirdness, however feigned – the character Zooey plays seems fleshed-out and authentic, like you would actually run into that girl and be annoyed with her in real life. Anyway, Zooey took part in Us Weekly’s “25 Things You Don’t Know About…” feature, and I can’t hate on her too hard:</p><p>1. I accidentally entered a beauty pageant.<br>2. I hate camping, but I love summer camp.<br>3. I took three years off from acting and toured with my band, She & Him.<br>4. I used to dress up like a princess to do my homework.<br>5. I have had brown hair and bangs since I was 2. One year I dyed it blonde, which felt so weird.<br>6. I drove my mom’s old Volvo until just a few years ago.<br>7. I had a party at the American Girl store — recently.<br>8. I love coffee. I mean, I really love coffee.<br>9. I am always early to work but sometimes late to other things.<br>10. I started a comedy website for females, with my friends Sophia and Molly, called HelloGiggles.<br>11. I know This is Spinal Tap by heart.<br>12. I am really competitive at board games.<br>13. I talk to my mom every day.<br>14. I love work more than vacations.<br>15. I love pictures of people’s dogs.<br>16. I am pretty crafty. I like to bake.<br>17. I hate papaya.<br>18. I use scrunchies. Don’t judge.<br>19. I love pajamas.<br>20. I am a true blue music nerd.<br>21. I love cereal.<br>22. Pastoralia by George Saunders is one of my favorite novels.<br>23. I have bows painted on my toenails.<br>24. I took six years of tap-dancing lessons.<br>25. My first acting job was as Little Red Riding Hood.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>]</p><p>Sigh…well, that explains the bangs at least. She’s always had bangs? I’m trying to remember if I’ve ever seen her bangs-less? If she ever grew them out, I would imagine that she would look even more like her older sister, Emily Deschanel.</p><p>Oh, and I kind of loved “I used to dress up like a princess to do my homework.” Who didn’t?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn5732664.jpg alt=wenn5732664 title=wenn5732664 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3473282.jpg alt=wenn3473282 title=wenn3473282 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3508706.jpg alt=wenn3508706 title=wenn3508706 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmanBoaIJ1e9mopp6xj5mytK%2FHmqWepKOUf3ar06Ggp5%2BjlK6vus6yoKefj6S%2FoLPEp6yippWhxqCtw6ipmpqcmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
