After all, it almost killed her.</p><p>Furthermore, even after she thankfully survived, her life was still greatly affected to the point that she was convinced she would never return to the stage again.</p><p>During her interview on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy, Demi opened up about her scary experience following her successful return to the stage at the Grammy Awards.</p><p>While she definitely got a lot of praise for her emotional singing at the awards show, Demi admitted that she was not even confident she would be able to make a comeback in the first place.</p><p>About ‘Anyone,’ the song she performed, she explained to Andy Cohen that ‘I knew it represented that period in my life when everything hit the fan. I knew that it represented everything that I was going through, the vulnerability… I have never had a moment like this where I have sat down at a piano and sang my heart out. I thought that, if I ever come back from this… I was still in the hospital. If I ever come back from this… I want it to be at the GRAMMY Awards and I want it to be this song.’</p><p>Sure enough, she got exactly what she wanted as her first time on stage following the overdose.</p><p>The song was a ‘cry’ for help for the singer since she apparently recorded it only days before her relapse and overdosed.</p><p>That being said, it makes sense that people were touched by it since it was so personal and raw.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for her career following the incident, she admitted that ‘Yeah, absolutely [I thought I might not return to music]. It was a general [thought] though. We did not know what would happen. We didn’t know how healthy I would be when I left. It was a very scary time in my life, for sure.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmrqqecuorZqsn2LAosXSZqqhnV2srrR5zairZqulp7Juv8eem2adppq%2FbrTAr5xmmV2YvK6xwZqapGWWpLmtu9aipaBlmJq%2FbrvVnqmdp6OaenSClGpnb2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
