Blah, right? We never quite start the week in our best mood. We feel tired, lazy and like we’d rather sleep for a few extra hours than tackle our responsibilities. But maybe there’s a way to face the day with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different perspective</a>.</p><p>Take <strong>Heidi Klum</strong>, for example. The supermodel and America’s Got Talent judge recently posted videos on her Instagram feed and Stories, dancing around in a striped triangle bikini set on a Monday morning. It was actually inspiring, to be honest. It made Us want to start our week dancing around too — especially in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cute swimsuit</a>!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CUPSHE Stripe V-Neck Back Cross Bikini</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$29</a> at Amazon!

That’s a bit out of our usual bikini budget, so we hopped on Amazon to find something similar, and we found a winner. It’s no surprise that it came from CUPSHE, our favorite California-inspire beachwear brand with always adorable — and affordable — picks!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This bikini set</a> also has a striped design with a triangle top. It has skinny white and navy stripes, plus an awesome strappy design in back. The top has an under-bust band for support, plus removable padded cups. The matching bottoms are lined and low-rise. We’re feeling like dancing just looking at this swim set!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CUPSHE Stripe V-Neck Back Cross Bikini</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$29</a> at Amazon!
