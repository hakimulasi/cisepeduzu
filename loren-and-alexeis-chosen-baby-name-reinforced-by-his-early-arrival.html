However, despite his biological name, they usually call him “Baby Boten.”</p><p>Even before he was born, the couple referred to Loren’s bump with the name, which translates to “peanut” in Hebrew. At one stage of pregnancy, their second child really would have been the size of a peanut!</p><p>However, they didn’t actually call their son “Boten” and instead have called him by another name since his arrival.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Baby Boten stay put! 👶🏻<a href=#>#LorenandAlexei</a> <a href=#>@TLC</a></p>— Jamie Steinberg (@NotYerAvgChick) <a href=#>February 1, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meaning-behind-baby-boten>Meaning behind ‘Baby Boten’</h2><p>Loren and Alexei have revealed their second child wanted to come into this world earlier than expected and on his own terms, and have referred to him as “Baby Boten” after calling their first boy Shai “Baby Brov” (as in Brovarnick).</p><p>Welcoming Asher via C-section, they kept their name plans a secret, which made things easier by calling Asher “Baby Boten” while she had him in her belly still. In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IG post</a>, Loren explained her firstborn’s name Shai means “gift.”</p><p>Due to having a C-section, Asher was likely born much smaller than if he would have arrived without a C-section, and therefore completely suits the term “Baby Boten”, aka “Peanut.”</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>US Weekly</a>, the TLC stars have also shared that their second child was born on August 16th and weighs a “whopping” 5 lbs. and 7 oz. He’s 19 inches tall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've watched their story from the beginning…all the ups and downs.

This was dangerous for Loren, as she had a cervical cerclage a few years ago, and if the baby pushed too hard then they could break the cerclage and come out.</p><p>The doctor said that if her baby came this early, they would have to spend at least four weeks in the NICU. This scared Loren, as she said she’s “not ready for that, that’s not how it’s supposed to go.”</p><p>Despite concerns from doctors due to being premature, Asher was born healthy and there were no major complications.</p><p>Loren announced his birth on her Instagram and wrote: “Due to some circumstances, he is in the NICU, but recovering well. We can’t wait to bring him home and start this next chapter as a family of 4!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Loren Brovarnik (@lorenbrovarnik)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH LOREN AND ALEXEI: AFTER THE 90 DAYS ON TLC EVERY MONDAY AT 9.30 PM</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> <strong>AND</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnnKS%2FprqMmqWdZZGhsrmxyKxknKCfqLKvecGambJlnpa6pnnRnqCnnp%2BnsKawjJuwZqCZqHqmrdGlsGaZoqe2t63L</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
