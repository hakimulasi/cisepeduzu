But the pain doesn’t seem to be a bother anymore. In fact, he was even able to catch up on some sleep during his latest appointment.</p><p>Canadian tattoo artist Nadia Katherine told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TMZ</a> on Wednesday, October 9, that the 31-year-old napped for most of his four-hour appointment. In a picture on her Instagram Story she shared afterward, he is shown with his eyes closed while she works away. Overtop the snap she wrote, “slept like an angel thur a neck tattoo.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aaron-Carter-4-Hour-Tattoo-Session-Inline.jpg><p>According to TMZ, Katherine offered to do it for free but Carter insisted on paying seeing as he’s definitely not afraid to drop some dough on body art. After all, he spent $5,000 just the week before on the massive Medusa/<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rhianna</strong></a> design he put on his face.</p><p>Tattoo artist Herchell L Carrasco told TMZ he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to cut off</a> the pop artist, who kept wanting to add more. “[He] wanted to keep going and I had to stop him,” Carrasco told the publication. “I couldn’t cover his whole face in a tattoo. I just couldn’t.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Some have expressed concern over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carter’s mental health</a>. After opening up about his multiple diagnoses, which includes “multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, acute anxiety and manic depression,” on The Doctors, his brother Nick Carter filed a restraining order against him. He claimed that Aaron made comments about wanting to harm his wife and unborn child. However, Aaron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied these claims</a>.</p><p>However, both tattoo artists assured TMZ that the “I’m All About You” singer seemed steady.</p><p>“Before I tattoo anyone, I take into consideration their mental state,” Carrasco said. “In Aaron’s case, I assessed the situation and I genuinely felt he was in a good place mentally to get tattooed.” Katherine also said he seemed “coherent.” And if he napped, clearly comfortable too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5aus7vNZpqaqqSav26%2Fy56nrWWknb%2BwwcahZKWhn6N6r7HCpGStmaSpvLB5wKmnqKGeqbqmutNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
