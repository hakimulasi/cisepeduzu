During “Vigilante S—t,” Swift dons a beaded indigo Oscar de la Renta body suit as she performs a sexy burlesque-inspired number. The choreography also features risqué moves on a chair.</p><p class=p1>According to Moore, who also <a href=#>helmed <i>DWTS</i>’ opening number</a> on Tuesday, Swift also “really” likes performing “Willow.” During the <i>Evermore</i> set, Swift and her dancers offer an ethereal and bewitching vibe thanks to their capes and handheld, glowing orbs.</p><p class=p1>“She did say to me, she’s like, ‘I really love coming out every night and doing these moves,’” Moore gushed about the “sweet” pop star.</p><p class=p1>Swift <a href=#>kicked off her <i>Eras</i> concert tour</a> in March in Arizona.

I dig her music and I dig her and I love her vision,” Moore, an Emmy-winning choreographer, added to <i>Page Six. </i>“It’s so nice to be on a team with somebody.”</p><p class=p1>Moore continued: “I’m not going to say it was easy. It was a ton of numbers in a very short amount of time, but I have to say, every day I went to work, I was just like, ‘This is amazing.’ … We’re in this massive stadium, putting it up, rehearsing it, and she just walks in, just normal, like sits on the stage and wants to practice whatever. I just love that that’s who she is!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>As someone <a href=#>who’s worked closely with Swift</a>, Moore also has an opinion on the singer’s whirlwind romance with <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>.
