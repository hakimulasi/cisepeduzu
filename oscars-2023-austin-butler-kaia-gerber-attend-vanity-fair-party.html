Gerber, 21, opted for a <a href=#>sparkling silver Celine dress</a> with a high slit.</p><p>The couple celebrated at the iconic afterparty despite Butler’s Best Actor loss — The Whale‘s <a href=#><strong>Brendan Fraser</strong></a> went home with the trophy — at <a href=#>the 95th annual Academy Awards</a>. Elvis earned a total of eight nods at the ceremony, including Best Picture and <a href=#>Best Director for <strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong></a>, but the film failed to pick up any wins.</p><p>Before Gerber joined him at the Vanity Fair bash, <a href=#>Butler walked the Oscars red carpet solo</a>. When asked why his girlfriend didn’t escort him at the Dolby Theatre, the Carrie Diaries alum explained that he wanted to enjoy the night with longtime pal <strong>James Farrell</strong>.</p><p>“I’ve got my best friend here with me, who is also my agent,” he told <a href=#><strong>Ashley Graham</strong></a>, who cohosted ABC’s pre-show with Butler’s ex <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a>. “And I owe my career to him, so as a thank you, I wanted him to be by my side tonight.”</p><p>One day before the awards show, Gerber attended the premiere of her film Bottoms at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed the duo’s relationship in December 2021 <a href=#>following the model’s split</a> from Euphoria‘s <a href=#><strong>Jacob Elordi</strong></a>.

They <a href=#>made their red carpet debut as a couple</a> at the Met Gala in May 2022, posing for photos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>The twosome have kept their relationship relatively out of the spotlight. During a GQ interview published in May 2022, <a href=#>Butler declined to speak about his personal life</a>. “I don’t think there’s anything I want to share about that,” he said of his romance with Gerber. “But thank you for providing the space.”</p><p>When it came to his split from Hudgens — <a href=#>Us broke the news in January 2019</a> that the actors called it quits after nearly nine years — Butler was equally as coy. “Life is full of changes, and you’ve got to find a way to constantly be evolving and growing,” he told the outlet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the Dune: Part Two star was a fixture on the red carpet this awards season, Gerber rarely joined him in front of the cameras. <a href=#>Butler won the Golden Globe</a> for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama in January and <a href=#>packed on the PDA with his girlfriend</a> to celebrate the milestone after the show.</p><p>Scroll down to see more of Butler and Gerber’s rare public appearance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvOrJqaqqNif3F%2BkmaYrquknrturtSto56qXaCuqq2MoJyrmpWneqLA056lnWWmlruqwNhmnZqhomK9or7TsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
