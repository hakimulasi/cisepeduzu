To start things off, fans will see Sam and Jason’s first meeting. General Hospital spoilers say this is what you can look forward to in an encore from December 3, 2003.</p><p>At the PCPD, Sam’s brought into the same interrogation room as Jason. They’ve both been arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), but Sam assures Jason she won’t testify against Sonny. Jason vows to make sure Sam’s got the best attorney possible for her defense.</p><p>Jasper “Jax” Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) is stunned to learn about Sam’s arrest and even more stunned when she insists on protecting Sonny. Sam bickers with Jax, who thinks Sam’s just one of the many women who risked all for Sonny’s sake. Nevertheless, Sam chooses to stand her ground.</p><p>After Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) and Emily Quartermaine bail Jason out, Jason warns Nikolas about Faith using Sonny’s problems to her advantage. Faith might try to take over even more criminal territories, so Jason thinks Nik should call her up and offer peace. That way Nikolas can fish for hints about whatever Faith’s planning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Courtney Matthews (Alicia Leigh Willis) eavesdrops on Faith, who brags to Zander Smith (Chad Brannon about making a drug deal on Sonny’s pier later. Faith thinks the money she receives from this deal will allow for a full takeover of the criminal activities in Port Charles. Faith expects total destruction of the Corinthos empire.</p><p>Over with Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst), she admits to Emily that she hasn’t gathered enough courage to tell Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst) and Zander about the baby. As for Nikolas, he meets with Faith and tries to get a feel for what her plans are. Unfortunately, Faith doesn’t reveal anything.</p><p>At the Quartermaine mansion, Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) lashes out over Dillon Quartermaine (Scott Clifton) and Georgie Jones (Lindze Leatherman) continuing to sneak visits. After Tracy warns she could send Dillon to military school, Dillon rants about how he doesn’t need Quartermaine handouts thanks to his new job.</p><p>Afterward, Dillon meets up with Georgie again and defends his decision to work for Lorenzo Alcazar (Ted King). This is helping Dillon stay out of military school and remain in Port Charles, but Georgie still doesn’t like it. Georgie would rather see Dillon in military school than dead.</p><p>At GH, Scott Baldwin’s (Kin Shriner) adamant that the case against Sonny is going to be a slam dunk. Once Jason arrives, Sonny tells him he thinks Scott and Alcazar are in on this together. Sonny feels like they’re both to blame for the trumped-up attempted murder charge. Jason brings Sonny up to speed on Sam and feels certain they can settle all this.</p><p>Carly Corinthos (Tamara Braun) requests a meeting with Lorenzo and convinces him not to testify against Sonny, but she insists Sonny could go after him again if he’s cleared. Back at GH, Ric pushes Sonny to say he kidnapped Sam or else she’ll go down as an accomplice.</p><p>Sonny confesses to kidnapping as Carly arrives and hopes they can get the confession thrown out, but Sonny thinks this is for the best.</p><p>While Scott informs Sam that she’s being released, Courtney fills Jason in on what she overheard about Faith’s intentions. Although Courtney doesn’t want Jason involved, he notes that he has to put a stop to what Faith has in store.</p><p>Jason heads down to the docks, where Nikolas distracts Faith long enough to let Sonny’s goons surround the place. Moments later, Jason blows up Faith’s shipment.</p><p>At home, Courtney slips off her wedding ring before someone shows up at the door. She’s taken aback when it’s Brian Beck (Michael McLafferty), not Jason. This GH classic should be a fun one to rewatch! We’ll pass along updates as other news comes in about future theme weeks.</p><p>For now, General Hospital spoilers say more “JaSam” episodes are on the way. CDL will have lots of other terrific <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">General Hospital spoilers, updates and news posts to pass along.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWlnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ympqecka56q8HNnmRral2orq55zJ6cratdn660u81mnaiqXam1pnnFoqmsrF2ptq6xjJymq6GeqbWwv4yepKmhopp6pbHSramum6SevK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
