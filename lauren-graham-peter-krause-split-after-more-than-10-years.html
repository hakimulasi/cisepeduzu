However, Graham and Krause’s relationship didn’t become romantic until they started working together on <a href=#>Parenthood</a> in 2010.</p><p>Graham played Sarah Braverman on the drama from 2010 to 2015, while <a href=#>Krause portrayed her brother</a> Adam Braverman.</p><p>“Nobody knew about it for a while <a href=#>because we like to be at home</a>, cooking and not going out,” the Hawaii native told Redbook in October 2010 of their quiet start as a couple. “I’ve also been really protective of it because it’s important that you can buy us as brother and sister on the show.”</p><p>The Talking as Fast as I Can author gave fans a glimpse at the pair’s private romance during a January 2017 interview with <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>.</p><p>“It’s not a big, loud life,” Graham explained. “We have a lot of neighbors, people come by, we’re with Peter’s son [Roman, whom he shares with ex <strong>Christine King</strong>] a lot and we keep it small.”</p><p>She noted that they got serious shortly after they decided to date. “Once we got together, there was no game play[ing],” the Evan Almighty actress said. “It was like, ‘You like me, and I like you.’ It gave me an understanding of life: This is how things happen, and it’s completely random.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star</a> shared an update on her and Krause’s dynamic in April 2021 while appearing on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>. Graham explained that after five months apart amid the COVID-19 travel restrictions, things had shifted.</p><p>“Normally it’s a two-hour flight, I’d come home on the weekends, but I couldn’t do that [because of COVID], so we were separated for almost five months, which had never happened before,” she said. “So when I came home the house was a little different. There were more piles, I would say.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Graham noted that she and the Six Feet Under alum spent a lot of quarantine with Krause’s 20-year-old son, and so when she was away for work, the men got into their own groove.</p><p>“I think the reentry was more difficult,” the <a href=#>Someday, Someday, Maybe author</a> confessed. “It was more like they were the married couple, and I was the person who … they were like, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore.’ They were like, ‘No, no, no, this is how things happen.’” She added that overall, their time as a trio was “fantastic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaWnsq95xquYoZmdYr2mwMSrZKSqkarApnnSqaOirF2Ws7Wx0WakqKqVYsGprc1maGllqZqus7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
