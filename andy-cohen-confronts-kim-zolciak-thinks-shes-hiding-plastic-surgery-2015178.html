But I want people to understand that I had a baby in 2011, one in 2012, and two in 2013, so I think the weight of all that, but no, I mean I haven’t. I did my boobs, my tummy, I did it on my show, and just I haven’t.”</p><p>A skeptical-looking Cohen wouldn’t let that answer go. He said that he thought she was wearing a pair of “librarian-that-can-be-seduced glasses” in order to hide the work she’s had done to her face.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m thinking, it is to take away from the fact that you have had a little bit shaved off your nose,” the candid host said. “I really feel that way. You have a little bit shaved off your nose and your lips are bigger.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum insisted she hadn’t had anything done other than overdrawing her lip liner. Cohen even asked Zolciak’s 18-year-old daughter, <strong>Brielle</strong>, who was in the audience, if she could clear it up for them.&nbsp;</p><p>“Look at my nose and look at her nose side by side,” Brielle shouted from her seat. “I feel like they look the exact same!”</p><p>Zolciak was insistent that she had been upfront about with all of her procedures.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Andy, I’m very honest with plastic surgery and I’ve never hidden anything,” the mother of six said. “We all know I do Botox. I’m a big fan of it. My lips are definitely overdrawn.”&nbsp;</p><p>Finally Cohen conceded, “I don’t know why you would deny it. I will say that.”</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Do you think Kim Zolciak’s had work done to her face?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJinnKlisLC0xKdknKeem7%2BwutOsZKShnWLHsLjCopikZaSdtq%2B30maqoZ2jYrWqsMinnmaonJbAtbXCZqquqpeav7p5kWlobmlnbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
