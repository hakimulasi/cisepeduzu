Either we want to have segregation or integration, and if we don’t want segregation, then we have to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we’d be up in arms. It’s a double standard.”</span></p><p><span>Ultimately, </span><a href=#>the BET network replied</a><span>, as did many of Dash’s opponents. BET published a slideshow the same day Dash made her comments on </span><i>Fox & Friends, </i><span>and called out the star for her many previous controversial remarks. “She thinks there needs to be a white history month too, since, you know, our ancestors apparently fought for nothing,” the network captioned one pic of Dash. “Clueless indeed.”</span></p><p>While many viewers were confused about Dash on Sunday, the ’90s actress <a href=#>took to her blog</a> to address her appearance on stage.&nbsp;<span>“Which brings me to the joke,” she wrote in a post published moments after her live appearance. “</span><span>When they added ME to increase the diversity, I’m sure many black people rolled their eyes. I’m not ‘black enough,’ they say. But guess what? I’ve heard that all my life. I would rather be a free thinking, black than a cookie cutter black who thinks – and votes – just like all my friends.”</span></p><p>Watch her awkward appearance above.&nbsp;<span><br></span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJGYsrp5w5qqoatdna6xvNhmmaWZk6B6qbXSraarsV2ivK%2FAx2amrJuRp8Bufo9qbWain6CybrLApaOsZZahrrV51mptbm1obXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
