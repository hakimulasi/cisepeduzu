He attended the University of Georgia. In 2017, he finished runner-up in the U.S. Open.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In college, Harman played golf for the University of Georgia and was a three-time 2nd Team All-American. He won the 2006 Isleworth Invitational as well as the 2005 NCAA Preview.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He also three times took home the prize for having the highest GPA for the year. Harman won the U.S. Junior Amateur in 2003.</p><p>He captured the Porter Cup in 2007 and the Players Amateur in 2005, shooting a record-setting 22-under 258. Harman was a member of the 2007 Palmer Cup and 2005, 2009, and winning Walker Cup teams.</p><p>Harman spent most of his 2010 season competing on the EGolf Professional Tour, placing in the top 10 in 11 of his 14 events. At the Manor Classic, where he won by three strokes, he earned his first professional triumph. In 2010, he also participated in three Nationwide Tour competitions.</p><p>On his previous collegiate course, his greatest performance came in the Stadion Athens Classic at UGA, where he finished T-18th.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A peculiar circumstance at the 2012 Players Championship made Harman famous. When D. A. Points withdrew a few minutes before his scheduled tee time, he was the first backup. After speaking with the PGA, tournament organizers decided to let Harman tee off alone for the opening round because playing companions Carl Pettersson and Robert Garrigus had already started their rounds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Later, Harman achieved major status and competed in the 2012 U.S. Open. The 2014 John Deere Classic was his first PGA Tour victory. In 2015, Harman led after 54 holes of the Travelers Championship, but he came in solo third after missing the playoff—which was won by Bubba Watson—by one stroke.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-brian-harman-wife-kelly-van-slyke><strong>Who is Brian Harman wife, Kelly Van Slyke?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jpg-696x418.jpg><p>After dating Kelly Van Slyke for a while, Brian Harman wed her in 2014. The union took place on December 13, 2014. However, if it weren’t for a Georgia-Auburn American football game, the pair would have wed months sooner. To be clear, Harman and Van Slyke had originally planned to wed in November, but they were forced to cancel since they believed that most of their guests would be at the game instead.</p><p>Van Slyke graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology from SUNY Genesco (State University of New York) in 2007. She was born in Syracuse, New York. The American currently works as a radiation therapist after having previously worked as a Pilates instructor at Pilates Loft in Georgia.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdl7%2Bqrc1mn5qqnZa7bsPIn5xmo5Whubp51ZqlZqucrrimew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
