On Wednesday, May 29, <strong>Stephen Baldwin</strong>'s youngest daughter wowed the crowd at the Mercedes-Benz hosted New York City premiere of After Earth, starring <a href=#><strong>Will</strong></a> and <strong>Jaden Smith</strong>.</p><p>Arriving at the Ziegfeld Theater before the movie, the blonde stunner rocked a short, fitted, black-and-white frock with sky-high nude platform heels. She was accompanied by her dad — the youngest of the four Baldwin brothers, behind Alec, <strong>Daniel</strong>, and <strong>William</strong> — who wore a black suit, blue T-shirt, and dark sunglasses.</p><p>"After Earth is an amazing movie and if you don't go see it there's something wrong with you. @officialjaden kills it!" Hailey <a href=#>tweeted</a> after the premiere, giving a shout-out to Jaden Smith.</p><p>Jaden, 14, is dating <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, 15, who is a friend of Hailey's. Earlier in the week, Kylie and Hailey met up with a few other pals for pizza in New York's West Village.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Day with my girls," Kylie <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Tuesday, May 28, along with a link to a picture of the stylish group.</p><p>Hailey is Stephen Baldwin's daughter with wife <strong>Kennya Baldwin</strong>, whom he married in 1990. The couple also have an older daughter, <strong>Alaia</strong>, 20. Both girls are said to be close with Ireland.</p><p>Speaking about their famous family in an interview with <a href=#>Page Six Magazine</a> last September, Alaia explained the bond between the younger Baldwin cousins. "No matter how much you think you understand a Baldwin, you really don't unless you are one," she said. "Ireland and I pretty sane for Baldwins."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BaoZyaxm6uwKWbsKGeYrazscuapZ1lkpa5pcPIp6pmm5%2BqwKq6jKyrrqajYq61ecCfq56qXZqus8DHZqernZ2esrOxjLCgraBdma6ledKtnKmglaN6o63Lna6ipl2ltqTA1KucZmpgZoB0fJQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
