According to the estranged couple’s marriage certificate, the Irish makeup artist, who died of suspected suicide last month, married Burton in Las Vegas in January 2013 at a wedding chapel called Heavenly Bliss.</p><p>Burton “is the legal next of kin,” <strong>Ed Winter</strong>&nbsp;with the Medical Examiner’s Office told <strong>Us</strong> previously.</p><p>As previously reported by<strong> Us</strong>, White was separated from her husband and had plans to file for divorce.</p><p>“As far as Jim was concerned, Cathriona was separated,” a source told<strong> Us</strong>. “She was going to start divorce proceedings in December. There is no way that Jim Carrey would have taken her out to public places if he thought she was married.”</p><p>The Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed to<strong> Us</strong> that White, 30, who dated Carrey on and off since 2012, was found with various prescription bottles and a note addressed to Carrey.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"There were four bottles found, three of them with a name on it and they weren’t hers,” the coroner’s office explained to <strong>Us</strong>. "We confirmed with the pharmacy it was an alias [for Carrey]…The prescriptions found were Ambien, Percocet, Propranolol and Zofran. [They were all in the name of Jim’s alias] except for the Zofran, there was no name on the [Zofran] bottle."</p><p>According to another source, White took the pills unbeknownst to Carrey. "Jim didn’t even realize until a couple days later because it’s not something that he took on a regular basis," the insider told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>A toxicology report has yet to be released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGipV2YrrO%2BxLKqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lk5bBqb7IqKWaZaedtrWxjLCYrGWdlr%2BztcSdZK2nXaKus7eMm6yrrJ%2BjenN8kG5tamg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
