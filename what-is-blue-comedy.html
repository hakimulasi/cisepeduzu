Nope, this genre is a craft. It’s about timing, delivery, and, believe it or not, some pretty sophisticated psychology.</p><p>Comedians who master this art know exactly how to walk that fine line between shockingly funny and just plain shocking.</p><h2><span id=Why-Is-It-Called-Blue-Comedy>Why Is It Called Blue Comedy</span></h2><p><strong>So, why the color blue?</strong> It’s not because these comedians are sad. The term blue has been kicking around the entertainment world for decades, often whispered in the back rooms of smoky night clubs where performers pushed the envelope.</p><p>Some say it hails from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blue Laws</a>, which regulated moral conduct in the past, including what performers could say on stage.</p><p>If your act was considered too blue, it was borderline—or over the line—of what was socially acceptable. In a way, to go blue was to go rogue with your humor.</p><h2><span id=Examples-of-Blue-Comedy>Examples of Blue Comedy</span></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rachelparris.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Examples-of-Blue-Comedy.jpg decoding=async alt="Examples of Blue Comedy" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>To give you a real taste of blue comedy, think of comics like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and more recently, Amy Schumer. These are the folks who serve up their observations with a no-holds-barred approach.</p><p>They tackle everything from <strong>sex to politics</strong>, all with a wink and a nod, knowing full well they’re delivering the comedic equivalent of a spicy jalapeño.</p><p>Remember George Carlin’s famous Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television? That bit was a blue comedy hallmark, not just for its shock value but for its commentary on censorship and freedom of speech. It was edgy, it was in-your-face, and yes, it was hilariously blue.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u1d37edc8fab70947ce569be9b0380a2a><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What is Roy Castle Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</span></a><p>And let’s not forget the likes of Mae West and Lenny Bruce, who were blue comedy pioneers, proving that this style isn’t just for the guys.</p><p>Mae West, in particular, delivered lines that could make you blush two shades of red, all while maintaining her glamorous composure.</p><p></p><h2><span id=TV-Shows-and-Stand-Up-that-Use-Blue-Comedy>TV Shows and Stand-Up that Use Blue Comedy</span></h2><h3><span id=Blue-Comedy-on-the-TV-Screen>Blue Comedy on the TV Screen</span></h3><p>When it comes to TV, blue comedy had to play it a bit coy, especially in the earlier years. You had shows like Married with Children or Sanford and Son, which, while not overtly blue, definitely dipped their toes in the waters with innuendo and brazen characters.</p><p>Fast forward a bit, and you hit shows like South Park and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Family Guy</a>, animations that may look kid-friendly but are steeped in blue humor, tackling everything from politics to personal idiosyncrasies with a boldness that only cartoons seem to get away with.</p><p>Then there’s the beloved <strong>The Office</strong> (US version), with Steve Carell’s Michael Scott delivering cringe-worthy yet hilarious lines that often venture into blue territory.</p><p>The show’s brilliance lies in its ability to be inclusive with its humor, ensuring the blue comedy serves the story and character development, not just there for shock value.</p><p>Another Blue comedy film that I want you to know is Airplane Mode (2019) written by<br>David Dinetz, Dylan Trussell, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Logan Paul</a> and Jake Paul. This piece of comedy film will deserve for anyone to explore what is blue value in comedic film.</p><h3><span id=Blue-Humor-on-the-Stand-Up-Stage>Blue Humor on the Stand-Up Stage</span></h3><p>On the stand-up stage, blue comedy is in its natural habitat. Stand-up allows comedians to interact directly with their audience, reading the room, and pushing as far as the crowd allows.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua7b9acc480302a79a5ca45f2835c5164><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What is Sammy J Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a><p>Comedians like <strong>Eddie Murphy</strong> in his iconic Raw performance or <strong>Dave Chappelle</strong> in his numerous Netflix specials exhibit the quintessential blue comedy style.</p><p>They deliver thought-provoking and side-splitting routines that touch on taboo subjects, often leaving the audience with a mix of shock, reflection, and, of course, laughter.</p><h2><span id=FAQs-about-Blue-Comedy>FAQs about Blue Comedy</span></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rachelparris.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FAQs-about-Blue-Comedy.jpg decoding=async alt="FAQs about Blue Comedy" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span id=Is-blue-comedy-offensive>Is blue comedy offensive?</span></h3><p>It can be.
