From that moment on, she begged her parents to enroll her in classes, but it wasn't something they could afford at the time. "We were very, very poor. We had no money. My mom was still in school, my dad was in college to be a schoolteacher," she explained to <a href=#>W</a>&nbsp;magazine.</p><p>Three years later, Song was just as committed to her love of acting, but she still hadn't been able to do anything about it. At the same time, she "got really, really sick" but wouldn't take her medicine, so her mom bargained with her: acting classes if she took her Robitussin. Song revealed that her mom planned to renege on that promise, so her grandmother stepped in. "My grandma took everything out of her savings, which was $523, and took me to this acting school that was not legit at all, but through them I met a real agent and started auditioning."</p><p>Song's first "big" role was in "The Ultimate Christmas Present," she <a href=#>recalled</a>. Every time she booked an acting job, her mom would take her down to L.A. for it, but they would always go back to their home in Sacramento afterwards. During those early years, it was more of an "after-school activity" than a career. "If I was bad, I didn't get to go to auditions. It wasn't the opposite, getting gifts to go to auditions," she told <a href=#>Refinery29</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5jbIZ4e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDInaWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdl7%2BmusOaZKynnpx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
