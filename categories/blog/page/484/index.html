Though best known as a&nbsp;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills member now, the reality star's connections to La La Land date back to her childhood, which was spent on movie sets â€” including 1978's slasher classic Halloween, alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, when Kyle was nine years old.
A child star just like her sister and former RHOBH co-star Kim Richards, Kyle, now 54, also had roles in movies and shows such as Little House on the Prairie, The Watcher in the Woods, ER, and others. <a href=../../../../real-housewives-kyle-richards-million-dollar-net-worth-how-much.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../rachel-bradshaw.html>Terry Bradshaw's Daughter, Rachel Bradshaw Found Love Again In Dustin Hughes; Widow Of Rob Bironas</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

But unlike many other similar stories as of late, Tom Ford's recently price-slashed 22,000-acre ranch isn't located anywhere near Los Angeles.
