You really don’t remember life before, that’s the craziest thing ever,” the &nbsp; “Diamonds” singer gushed of becoming a mom in <a href=#>a February profile for <i>British Vogue</i></a>. “You literally try to remember it — and there are photos of my life before — but the feeling, the desires, the things that you enjoy, everything, you just don’t identify with it because you don’t even allow yourself mentally to get that far, because … it doesn’t matter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rihanna-and-ASAP-Rocky-Stuck-With-R-Initial-Theme-for-2nd-Son-Name.jpg><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “Essentially, from one person, I became two.
