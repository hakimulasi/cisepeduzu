The two rap stars have been at loggerheads since 2005 when 50 Cent’s song The Massacre was pushed back in order to give The Game’s debut album more importance, given that they both were then in the same rap group, G-Unit.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2022, The Game, allegedly in a bid to get back at 50 Cent, outed Jamira for having DMed him. “Oh’ n tell ya girl stay out of my DM’s… if she don’t want her man overweight, fat as f***…”, The Game ridiculed.

Keep in mind.”</p><h2><strong>All The Women 50 Cent Has Dated in the Past</strong></h2><h3><strong>Shaniqua Tompkins</strong></h3><p>50 Cent’s first known relationship was with Shaniqua Tompkins and it lasted from 1994 to 1998.
