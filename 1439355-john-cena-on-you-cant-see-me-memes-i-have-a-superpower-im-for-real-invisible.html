People have been using <a href=#>Cena</a>‘s catchphrase against him and have turned him into a meme.</p><p>It is, of course, the ‘You Can’t See Me’ line. Fans have been jokingly claiming that they can’t see John Cena for the past 15 years. Recently, on <a href=#>Logan Paul’s </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impaulsive</a><a href=#> podcast</a>, the 16-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion claimed that he has never gotten sick of these jokes.</p><p>“Not once. Not once [does John Cena gets sick of the ‘You Can’t See Me’ jokes.] I went through a stretch where I was like, ‘Man! This has got some staying power.’ Because the first time I heard it, it might have been ’09. It’s 2024 bro. And I still am invisible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-john-cena-trolled-by-jake-paul>John Cena trolled by Jake Paul</h2><p>Cena also shared the story about how he was so excited to meet Jake Paul but Paul made fun of Cena with the infamous meme as well.</p><p>“I was so f***ing happy to meet him [Jake Paul]. An inspiration to me. I was moved by the Doc [Jake Paul documentary]. I thought it was so vulnerable and great. And for someone like I said, to start so late and achieve fluency and mastery so quickly, is a just a byproduct of hard work, effort. I… I’m drawn to passion and effort. I’m like, ‘Yo’ [Goes to shake hands with Jake]. He goes over here [shakes hands with mid-air] ‘John hey.’ [Cena said to himself] ‘Oh my god! I got to do the thing one more time. I got to be invisible one more time.’ It’s great. Dude, I have a superpower. I’m f***ing for real invisible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The former WWE Champion also mentioned that he is pleased with all the jokes and memes. Cena sees it in a way that his work has affected the viewers in some way shape or form.</p><p>“You said in the car about the South Park gimmick. The South Park episode. You were pleased. Yeah, what am I supposed to say? Does it hurt my feelings? No. It’s your way of saying, ‘Your work affected me some way.’ It’s f***ing awesome right?” John Cena said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNscGxtZWK3sLTNZpqeppFivK952KisZpuRo8Fuv8SeZKadXaKyrrHSZqBmoJGrsm6tjKysqZ2ipby4sdFmoKZllqS%2Fbr7EmqNmoZ6rtrS1waWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
