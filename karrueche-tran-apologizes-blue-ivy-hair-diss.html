I love you!” But her apology came too late, and the Twitterverse promptly attacked Karrueche for what she said!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kae took to Twitter to apologize, saying:”Now y’all know I LOVE me some Beyoncé and Blue Ivy! I didn’t write this script y’all lol.” But it seems that wasn’t enough. So on Aug. 26, Karrueche released the following statement through her publicist:&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Yesterday, Karrueche Tran co-hosted 106 & Park and while hosting the show, she made a comment about Blue Ivy’s hair during the segment “Top Six Things Blue Ivy Thought at the VMAs”. In no way did Karrueche mean to offend Blue Ivy or her parents,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beyonce</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jay Z</a></strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This was Karrueche’s first time hosting on live television. Although she had been rehearsing the script for days, there was a script change ten minutes before showtime to add coverage of the VMAs and the Mike Brown Memorial. Karrueche had not reviewed the revised script until she read it on the teleprompter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Karrueche is taking full responsibility for the comment but wants it clear that she would not mock a child, “I am a huge Beyonce fan and I love Blue Ivy. I apologize for the comment and wish I had a chance to review the revised script so that I could have avoided participating in that segment.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Karrueche admires girls and women who wear natural hair, “I love that Blue is able to wear her natural hair. I laugh when I am nervous and when I registered what I had just said, I of course was taken aback.”</p><h3>BET Executive: Don’t ‘Hate On Karrueche’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>BET’s President of Music Programming and Specials, <strong>Stephen Hill</strong>, also took to Twitter&nbsp;on Aug. 26 to apologize for the offensive comment, saying:</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Last night on 106 & Park there was a stupid, unthoughtful joke made about a young child. We apologize publically to the child’s parents (and have done so privately) and we have taken punitive actions with those responsible.It was very bad judgment and we will serve you much better in the future. Oh, and please don’t hate on Karrueche; it was NOT her fault. We also apologize to her for putting her in that position.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>So&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>,&nbsp;do YOU think Karrueche’s apology was sincere? Did Blue Ivy fans take the joke too seriously? Let us know!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>— Sandra Clark</strong></p><h3>More Blue Ivy News:</h3><li>Blue Ivy Carter Fans Slam Karreuche Tran For Dissing Her Natural Hair</li><li>Karrueche Tran Disses Blue Ivy’s Hair On ‘106 & Park’ — Watch</li><li><a href=#>Blue Ivy: Fans Rave Over Beyoncé & Jay Z’s Daughter After VMA Dancing<br></a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH15e5FvZqSZoqfCpq%2FHnmStqpGjeqK8zqWmoKGqmsBursuunGahpq56qa3Iq2SdoaOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
