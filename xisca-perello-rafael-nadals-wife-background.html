She was born on July 7, 1988, in Palma de Majorca, Spain, Maria Francisca Mara Pascual is her mother’s name, while Bernat Perelló is her father. She prefers to be referred to as Xisca, her nickname.</strong></p><p>Whike others became famous because of their profession over the years, others rise to stardom because of their association or relationship with them. Xisca Perello is a good example.</p><p>She became very famous when she began to date popular tennis star, Rafael Nadal. The duo dated for a while before they eventually got married in 2019.</p><p>Even though, she is popular, Xisca Perello has managed to keep her life private. She’s not available on any social media platform even though several fan pages have been made on her behalf.</p><p>In this post, we shall tell you what we know about Xisca Perello, Rafael Nadal’s wife in this post. You will get to learn about her background, career, net worth among other details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education></span>Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Xisca Perello studied Business Administration and English in London, UK.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From an early age, Maria Francisca Perello had high aspirations. She was raised to be fiercely independent because both of her parents worked. She continued her education after high school by enrolling in a Business Management program in London, UK.</p><p>She <a href=# rel=noopener>went on to work</a> for “MAPFRE,” a sporting organization that also supported her lover Rafael Nadal, after successfully completing her education. But Perello’s career decision had a disappointing result. She has always realized that being involved with Nadal would make her the center of attention more than anyone else. But she wasn’t ready for the hostile work environment she encountered at “MAPFRE.”</p><p>She resigned from her position amid accusations that many of her coworkers believed she was only hired because of her relationship with Nadal. After returning to Majorca, she began working for an insurance provider.</p><p>As soon as paparazzi photos of her and Nadal together appeared, the world became aware of their relationship. Even then, Nadal refused to discuss her during press conferences since she was not interested in living in the spotlight. She moved in with Mara Isabel Nadal, Rafa’s sister, at this period, and the two grew close.</p><p>The tennis pro established the “Rafael Nadal Foundation” in 2008 to provide socially underprivileged kids with a chance at a normal existence.</p><p>Xisca Perello made the decision to join the foundation and ultimately rose to the post of “Projects Director,” which she still occupies today. All those working with the foundation praise her for her upbeat, kind demeanor as well as her commercial savvy.</p><p>In addition, dating one of the greatest tennis players of all time will bring celebrity and media attention, despite her best efforts to prevent it.</p><p><br>However, Maria Francisca Perello’s purposeful choice to avoid social media and refrain from discussing Rafael Nadal with reporters has made her life a little bit simpler. However, paparazzi continue to follow the couple and frequently take images of the Spanish beauty.</p><p>Despite all the fanfare, Maria rarely shows up to watch Nadal play. She added in an interview that the choice was mutual and that Nadal need space when competing and that she would grow weary if she had to stand by waiting on his requirements.</p><p>” If I followed him everywhere, I suppose there’s a possibility we may stop getting along,” she added, citing this as the secret to their happy relationship. This is also a major factor in why she has gained so much popularity among Rafa’s supporters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Xisca_Perello_and_Rafael_Nadal_meet></span>How did Xisca Perello and Rafael Nadal meet? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She had known Nadal since high school, but their relationship didn’t begin until late 2005. They met each other through a mutual buddy. In London, UK, she pursued studies in both business administration and English.</p><p>She found it difficult at first, but she eventually acquired English so she could get by in London. She has barely discussed their relationship since they started dating, and she likes to avoid social media. Xisca even acknowledged that, because she is a very private person, she hardly ever discusses Nadal with her own family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Xisca_Perello_Net_worth></span>Xisca Perello Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Raphael Nadal’s wife Xisca Perello is reported to have a net worth of about $500,000. Her salary as a project director at the Rafael Nadal Foundation is roughly from $34K to $109K.</p><p>Rafael Nadal, her husband, is thought to be worth $35 million. Additionally, Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar was established by Nadal in Spain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marriage></span>Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Perello and Nadal, who had been dating since 2005, wed in January 2019, not long after declaring their engagement.</p><p>About 350 people attended the lavish wedding at the La Fortaleza palace in Majorca, including well-known actors Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston, David Ferrer, Hugh Laurie, and many others.</p><p>The pair is without children, but Nadal has said he intends to have children after he hangs up his tennis racket. Despite being 35 years old, Nadal is still at the top of the game.</p><p>They intend to return to Spain after his career is over to begin a new life as a retired tennis player.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frequently_Asked_Questions></span>Frequently Asked Questions <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsaGjmK5uvMSrnKWkn2K%2ForLAnqNmppGZrq2%2FjLCgn51dl66kt8arpq6mlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
