In a new social media post the singer teases her new music while flaunting her ageless beauty, posing on the beach in a bathing suit. "This song Nassau is my take on Afrobeat ðŸŒ´ â€“ it's on my new album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran coming MARCH 22," she captioned the series of snaps. "What was Pique thinking? Bro messed up," one of her followers commented, referencing the cheating scandal that broke up her marriage. "This woman since she broke up with pique has rejuvenated, looks like she was 30 years old, queen of longevity," added another follower. How does the singer approach health and wellness? Here is everything you need to know about her lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shakira has been working out five days a week with Anna Kaiser and her dance-cardio based method for several years. "We alternate between strength and cardio intervals. Some days we do just cardio and then strength and some days we start with strength and then do cardio, we like to mix it up," Kaiser told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>E! News</span></a><span>. "I want to make sure that she is improving her endurance so that she can go into a two-hour show and also has the strength and stamina to make it through a five-month tour. It's about making sure she gets a little bit of everything."</span></p><p><span>During the pandemic Shakira started skating and surfing. "These new hobbies that I never thought I'd be able to take on later in life, Skating and surfingâ€”they are very therapeutic and liberate my mind," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cosmopolitan</span></a><span>. "I'm not a great surfer. I just started a year ago, and it's a hard sport to make progress on. It's unbelievable how much pleasure I find in this. How all my troubles are washed away by the waves. There's something about the ocean and the salt and the wind that heals all the wounds. I found that's my own meditation, but it wouldn't be bad if I do the real kind. I think I need it."</span></p><p><span>Shakira wears a heart monitor. According to Kaister it "keeps her the most focused," and enables her to reach her fitness goals. "Maintaining a certain heart rate for a prolonged period of time can help you burn more calories and fat while also improving your cardiovascular health," confirmed Chris Travers, MS, to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span>. Also, "it's also possible to overexert yourself, and a heart rate monitor can alert you to that danger, too."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/shutterstock_2236596235.jpg><p><span>"Breakfast could be eggs or avocado with olive oil, tomato, sea salt, then a smoothie, berries, plant protein, sometimes greens or green powder," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Kaiser </span></a><span>dished "Then for lunch, we have fish and fresh vegetables or a salad with lots of colors. Afternoon is, I know it gets really busy, but we'll do soup. There are some really good artichoke soups, or it could be a leek and eggplant soup, carrot ginger, and sometimes with a side of cucumbers with lemon and salt. For dinner, she'll also do fish and veggies. It's usually cold for lunch and warm for dinner."</span></p><p><span>Shakira uses a foam roller, which encourages flexibility, her trainer says. "When you're hypermobile, it's easy to think your muscles are flexible, but your flexibility is really around your joints and not your muscles," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Kaiser </span></a><span>explained. "Foam rolling is really important and making sure we are rolling out her fascia, her feet, her legs, and upper body to make sure she stays nice and healthy."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLS0wKSgq5ldobywt9JmaWllqZqus7%2BMsqauppeav261zWalnq9dpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
