In the time leading up to Wayne’s murder in February 1987, Mary testified that the household <a href=#>dealt with a lot of violence.</a> As per reports, someone Priscilla was secretly dating had wrecked Wayne’s car after she had lent it to that person. However, on the show, Priscilla stated that she didn’t date that man.</p><p>Mary testified that after finding his car damaged, Wayne was angry and <a href=#>attacked</a> Priscilla and then put a knife to her throat. Later in the night, Mary said that Priscilla woke her up and took her to the living room, where Wayne was passed out in the chair. Mary remembered a .22 caliber rifle with Priscilla. She later said, “She (Priscilla) told me, ‘I need you to shoot him in the head. If you do this,’ she said, ‘it will all be over. You’re not gonna go to jail, you’re too young.'” But Mary later recalled that she didn’t want to do it.</p><p>In the end, Priscilla was insistent, and Mary, who was 11 at the time, shot Wayne in the stomach because she couldn’t shoot him in the head. The gun fired on the third try. During Priscilla’s trial in 1988, Mary testified, saying she only shot Wayne because her mother asked her to. Priscilla, who took the stand in her defense, talked about the abuse that she faced while married to Wayne. According to the show, she said that he forced her to have sex several times, sometimes even with a dog.</p><h2>Where is Priscilla Bailey Today?</h2><p>In the end, the jury found Priscilla Bailey guilty of first-degree murder in June 1988. While she was sentenced to life in prison, she was eligible for parole after 10 years. As per the show, Mary was put in the foster care system but was never adopted. She continued to visit her mother in jail and testified at her parole hearing in 1998. Priscilla was released at that point, and Mary took her in.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=563293 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-are-priscilla-bailey-and-mary-bailey-now/mary-b4/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mary-b4.jpg data-orig-size=979,499 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="mary b4" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mary-b4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mary-b4.jpg?w=979" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mary-b4.jpg alt width=979 height=499 sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>However, Mary stated on the show that Priscilla seemed to return to her old habits; she had gotten pregnant again.
