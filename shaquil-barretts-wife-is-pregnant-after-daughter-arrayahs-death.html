I just know Arrayah had a special hand in picking this sweet girl to add to our family,” Jordanna, 30, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Friday, June 30. “We are so beyond blessed, so beyond grateful that <a href=#>God chose to give us another little girl</a>!”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “We miss our Arrayah every second of every day, but I rest in knowing she’s going to be the best big sister angel to little miss Allanah!&nbsp;… Arrayah has given me hope. She has changed so many lives with the short 2 years she blessed this Earth, and God works in such mysterious ways, but I will never ever doubt his plans for my life. Through the worst of the worst, he turns and uses ALL things for good. I will trust when it’s the hardest, and praise him through all things good. His plans are far more better than my own and always always will be.”</p><p class=p1>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker, 30, and his wife — who <a href=#>also share three older children</a> — revealed that their little one <a href=#>will be named Allanah Ray</a>.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Shaq, Jordanna and the entire Barrett family during this unimaginably difficult time,” a statement on<a href=#> the Bucs official Twitter page</a> read at the time. “While no words can provide true comfort at a time such as this, we offer our support and love as they begin to process this very profound loss of their beloved Arrayah.”</p><p class=p1>A police report obtained by the Associated Press at the time noted that Arrayah’s death was <a href=#>a “purely accidental and tragic incident.”</a></p><p class=p1>Less than one week later, Jordanna broke her silence on her daughter’s loss. “Our world will never be the same,” she <a href=#>wrote via Instagram on May 3.</a> “Arrayah was the apple of my eye, and my heart will forever be with hers. … Until we see each other again, please watch over your siblings and momma and dada. We love you forever and ever and always. I can’t wait to see that precious smile again, and just hug you so close. I would do absolutely anything. There is no Barrett 6 without you, and we will forever hold your place down here, until we all meet again in heaven. I love you forever and always.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Jordanna commemorated the late toddler’s memory <a href=#>several weeks later by getting a wrist tattoo</a> of angel wings and a halo.</p><p class=p1>Shaquil and Jordanna, who were <a href=#>high school sweethearts</a>, got married in February 2012.
